# AGENTS.md

Conventions for `courier`, the cafaye notification service. Read this before
changing anything. The house rules in `moon/PLAN.md` §1 and §3 apply on top of
it: tests first, every packet ends in a green suite and a commit, never push
from a worker branch.

## What this repository is

`courier`, Elixir 1.20 / OTP 29, Phoenix 1.8, **API only**: no HTML, no
LiveView, no assets, no dashboard, no gettext. It owns transactional email,
notification preferences, and every outbound webhook. The contracts and the
manifest schema are owned by `cafaye/core`; `cafaye.yml` here is a draft
validated against `core/schemas/cafaye.manifest.schema.json` and is regenerated
by `caf init` when core freezes the format. Nothing is copied from
`moon/refs/jumpstart-pro` — it is a behavioral spec for later packets, and
PLAN.md §2 forbids copying from it.

                                      a real socket, and the failure paths
test/courier/mailer_adapter_test.exs  the adapter courier refuses to ship
                                      without, and the two boot gates

                                           caller controls, in nothing exported
test/courier/secret_box_test.exs      a secret is not readable from its column

                                      material, and README's data-loss window
test/courier/backup_tables_test.exs  what a pg_dump carries, read out of

test/courier/inbound_test.exs         THE PROOF: the whole inbound path against a
                                      real email_suppressions table, so "an unsigned
                                      payload records nothing" is a claim about rows

test/courier_web/controllers/          the API, and the authorization matrix
test/courier_web/controllers/messages_controller_test.exs  the send surface:

test/courier_web/plugs/idempotency_test.exs  the header over real requests: one
                                           mutation, the replays, and the three 409s
test/courier_web/openapi_document_test.exs  openapi.yaml against the router, both
                                           directions, and why the probes are
                                           the only omission
test/courier_web/openapi_paths_test.exs     the reader, a test per normalisation,
                                           and the comparison with faults injected
test/support/openapi_paths.ex        the reader and the comparison the two above

## Rules

**Tests first, and show the red.** Write the test, run it, watch it fail for the
reason you expect, then implement (PLAN.md §3). A probe test that passes
without the route is worse than no test.

**The probes are production infrastructure.** `mix test` must cover both, and
the DB-down path must be a real one: `health_controller_test.exs` stops
`Courier.Repo` under the application supervisor rather than mocking the check.
Keep the failure response terse and log the reason instead — probe responses
are read by orchestrators, and this repository is public.

**A readiness check never raises.** Anything that can go wrong with the database
comes back as `{:error, reason}` from `Courier.Health.ready?/1`. Delivery here
is at-least-once, and a probe that takes down the endpoint is a self-inflicted
outage.

**Versions live in two places, not three.** `mise.toml` and the `ARG`s at the
top of the `Dockerfile` (Elixir 1.20.4, OTP 29.1.1). `mix.exs` keeps the `~>`
floor for library consumers; do not pin an exact version there.

**No dependency without approval.** The generated Phoenix 1.8 app is the whole
dependency list. Swoosh, Oban, Broadway, and the HTTP clients for the webhook
pipeline are Phase 3 packets — not this one, not "just to prepare".

**A mailer with no adapter that can reach a provider is a silent default, and
that is worse than a crash.** courier ships `{:swoosh, "~> 1.28"}` and
`{:gen_smtp, "~> 1.0"}`, and the second one is the load-bearing half: swoosh
declares `gen_smtp` OPTIONAL and `Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP` declares it REQUIRED, so
naming swoosh alone compiles a courier whose only shipped adapter is
`Swoosh.Adapters.Local` — which renders into memory, returns a provider-shaped id
and opens no socket. That is the state this repository was in: a paid product
that accepted every send, wrote an outbox row for each, published a `delivered`
event, and mailed nobody. No error, no warning. Three rules came out of it:

  * **The adapter has no default, and prod will not boot without one.** Not
    "warned about" — refused. A running courier that cannot send is worse than
    one that will not start, because the damage is outbox rows and events
    claiming delivery, for mail that was never delivered, and nothing in a
    dashboard shows it. `Courier.MailerAdapter.adapter!/1` raises in
    `config/runtime.exs`; `Courier.Application` re-checks the EFFECTIVE adapter
    as a second, independent gate — the same input twice would catch nothing, so
    the second one reads `Application.get_env` rather than the environment.
  * **`Swoosh.Adapters.Test` and `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` are named in
    `Courier.MailerAdapter.silent_adapters/0` and asserted as a set.** A third
    silent adapter has to be classified, or the set test fails. `none` is
    permitted in dev and refused in prod; the value is a NAME from a fixed set,
    never a module name, so the silent adapter cannot be named through the front
    door the refusal was built to close.
  * **An adapter no test can exercise is an adapter nobody has checked.** So
    `gen_smtp` is in EVERY environment, not `only: :prod`, and
    `test/courier/smtp_delivery_test.exs` drives real sends through the real
    adapter to a real `:gen_smtp_server` on a real kernel-assigned loopback port.
    Mocking the adapter would prove the mock works. The mutation is the proof:
    point those tests at `Local` or `Test` and five of the six fail.

**A credential is never in a log, and never in a committed file.** At SMTP a
"username" is usually an API key, so `Courier.MailerAdapter.describe/1` prints
the host, the port and whether auth is on, and omits *both* credentials — the
startup line an operator reads is not where a password belongs.
`test/courier/mailer_adapter_credentials_test.exs` captures real log output from
real sends and asserts the secret is ABSENT, which is the assertion worth more
than "it logged something": a boundary that deletes everything passes that. Two
tests in it are about the repository rather than about a call — no committed
`config/*.exs` may carry `username:`/`password:`/`relay:` inside a
`config :courier, Courier.Mailer` block — and they are scoped to the mailer's own
block because `config/test.exs` legitimately commits `password: "postgres"` for
the test database. A scan loosened until it goes green is a scan that has stopped
looking.

One packet has been approved since, and the two names it added are
`{:opentelemetry, "~> 1.7"}` and `{:opentelemetry_exporter, "~> 1.11"}`: the
trace SDK and the OTLP exporter, in **every** environment including test, because
without them courier cannot emit a span at all and kit's collector has nothing to
redact. They are the floor, not a choice among alternatives — the alternative was
courier exporting nothing and the whole redaction boundary being untested. What
was **not** added is as load-bearing: no `opentelemetry_metrics` (the Erlang SDK
has no metrics API — measured, `ls deps/opentelemetry/src | grep -c metric` is
`0`), no `opentelemetry_logger` (logs come from the collector's `syslog/crash`
receiver via compose `logging:`, which is a property of the container rather than
a per-language SDK), and no `opentelemetry_phoenix` (it would record
`url.path`, `url.query` and headers as its own attributes, and depending on the
engine to strip them would make courier's boundary one control where this
repository insists on two).

**`mix precommit` before you commit.** It compiles with warnings-as-errors,
drops unused deps from the lockfile, formats, and runs the suite. `bin/prime`
is the gate for a clean checkout; `mix precommit` is what a change must pass.

**The gate is declared in `gate.yml`, not discovered.** Written against
`cafaye/core`'s `schemas/gate.schema.json` and checked by its
`harness/bin/gate-check`, which reads `command`, `miseTask`, `entrypoint`, the
`external.requirements`, the `ci` block, and the `proof`. Two things follow.
First, the proof: `bin/prime` must print `Result: N passed` at or above the floor
in `gate.yml`, and that is what separates a gate from a command that exits zero —
`1/1 passed` and `3/3 passed` are the same claim without a floor. When the suite
grows, **raise `gate.proof[].minimum` in the same commit**, the same rule that
already applies to CI's `bin/assert-suite` floors. Second, the requirements: the
gate needs a migrated postgres, the pinned toolchain, and one hex fetch, and
`selfContained: false` with that list is the honest answer. **A gate that needs
something and does not say so is the defect this format exists to prevent**, so
add a requirement rather than letting the gate quietly assume one.
`bin/gate-self-test` breaks `gate.yml` nine ways and asserts core's checker
catches each; it is a CI step of its own, not part of `bin/prime`, because a
self-test inside every gate invocation is a second gate that can disagree with
the first.

**The CI gate is `bin/prime`, the same command, not a CI variant of it.** If the
two can disagree, one of them is lying. The workflow adds a database, the tier
counts and the lockfile guard *around* that command; it does not reimplement it.

**The send path's HTTP door is `POST /v1/messages`, and its contract is
`synchronous`.** The whole send happens inside the request — the preference is
read, the suppression list is consulted, the provider is dialled, the outbox row
is written — so the caller learns the real outcome rather than a receipt for an
intention. **A 200 means the provider accepted the message for delivery and
courier wrote the `courier.email.delivered` row in the same transaction; it does
not mean the mail arrived**, because a submission protocol says nothing about
arrival and courier has no receipt to report one with. `data.status` is therefore
`accepted` and is never `delivered`: a field reading `delivered` would be courier
claiming a fact about somebody else's inbox that it cannot know.

The queued alternative was considered and is real — `Courier.Workers` exists and
`oban` is already a dependency — and it loses on one requirement: **a 202 answers
before the suppression check has run**, so a refusal arrives after the response and
a caller who cannot tell "suppressed" from "sent" retries forever. The availability
price of the synchronous choice is stated rather than assumed: courier holds a
database transaction open across the provider's dial, and a slow provider makes
this request slow. What makes it survivable is that the failure is honest (a 503
with a code the caller retries) and the retry is free under an `Idempotency-Key`.

**Three refusals, told apart by status and `code` and not by `detail`**, because a
client branches on the code:

| outcome | status | `code` | retry? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accepted for delivery | 200 | — | — |
| the recipient's mailbox is suppressed | 409 | `conflict` | **no** |
| the request is wrong, or the user declined this type | 422 | `validation_failed` | after fixing it |
| the provider refused, or courier cannot deliver | 503 | `unavailable` | yes, same key |

**A suppressed mailbox is a 409 and not a 422**, and the reason is that it is not a
property of the request: a hard bounce and a spam complaint are facts about a
*mailbox*, recorded by a provider and not chosen by this caller, and the table
behind them is never exposed through any route — so this response is the only
place the fact can surface. **A declined preference is a 422**, the opposite answer
on purpose, because a decline is visible through
`GET /v1/notification_preferences/{user_id}` and changeable through the `PUT` beside
it, and `errors[]` — which core reserves for 422 and nothing else — can name `type`
as the field at fault. One code for two different remedies would have been worse
than either.

The suppression response deliberately **does not echo the address** and carries no
`errors[]`: `email_suppressions` has no `account_id` by design, so the 409 is a
fact about a mailbox rather than about another tenant's data, and a status nobody
can read the list through is the same posture the suppression packet took when it
declined to expose one.

**The send path consults suppression, and the controller does not.** Both live in
`Courier.Deliver` — the preference first, then the mailbox — because a hard-bounced
address does not get mail *whatever the caller asked for*, and every caller of that
module is a caller of that promise. `Courier.DeliverTest` and the endpoint's own
tests assert it from both sides; `messages_controller_test.exs` proves it from the
library side precisely because a check that lived only in the controller would be a
check the library could fail.

**The send surface's vocabulary is closed, and that is the point.**
`Courier.Mailers` casts a payload with `Ecto.Changeset.cast/3` against a fixed field
list and **discards everything else without a word** — right for a library a trusted
caller holds, wrong for a request body, where a misspelled `emai_enabled` would be
accepted with no sign anything was ignored. So `CourierWeb.Messages` refuses an
unknown key as a 422 naming it, and `account_id` is in that set: the account is
`conn.assigns.current_account` and never the body's.

**There is no `from` and no `text`/`html` in the request, and both absences are
deliberate.** courier sends *transactional* mail it renders from its own templates.
A caller that could choose the sender would be a phishing relay wearing the
platform's sending domain, and the reputation cost lands on every other tenant's
mail; raw bodies on the wire would make courier a general-purpose relay handing out
every template, layout and escaping decision. So the sender and subjects stay
configuration, and a body carrying `from` is a 422 naming `from`.

What survives of "at least one of text/html" is `Courier.Mailers.body?/1`, a check
on the **rendered** message called from `Courier.Deliver` where the message is the
only thing in hand — and it is a 500 rather than a 422 when it fails, because the
caller's request was fine and courier's own template rendered nothing. `Swoosh`
delivers a bodiless email and answers a provider-shaped id, so without the check a
message with nothing in it would be recorded as delivered and published as
`courier.email.delivered`: the same silent default the adapter work refuses,
reached by a different road. It is tested on hand-built messages as well as on a
real render, because a predicate that only ever sees messages it is guaranteed to
accept is a predicate nothing has checked.

**The adapter gate is asked a third time, per request, and the reason is
visibility.** `Courier.MailerAdapter` refuses to boot and `Courier.Application`
re-checks the *effective* adapter; this action asks the same predicate again so the
refusal reaches the caller as a 503 instead of being a boot-time property nobody
sees. A courier that booted with a silent adapter would otherwise answer 200, write
an outbox row and publish `courier.email.delivered` for mail nobody receives. It is
scoped to `:prod` exactly as `verify_boot!/1` is, because `Test` and `Local` are the
correct adapters in the environments that configure them — and reaching that scope
from a test is why `MailerAdapter.config_env/0` reads application env rather than
`Mix.env/0`.

**A 503 on a customer operation is new, and it moved a list in
`openapi_error_responses_test.exs` rather than being added to it.** That file's
`@unreachable` map asserted that no operation declared a 503, because only
`GET /readyz` sent one. A send has a dependency courier does not control, so the
status became reachable and the fix was to **correct the list and say why** — which
is what its own comment instructs. A third status left that map (409 in courier-14)
and the second departure is what shows the map is a list and not a constant.

**A tier that CI cannot name is a tier nobody ran.** The suite partitions
exactly, by the case template: 577 tests in the 25 files that never touch
`Courier.Repo`, 579 in the 28 that do, and `mix test` is aliased to
`ecto.create` first, so a runner with no database executes *zero* of the 1156 —
SSRF table included. Both counts are asserted in CI by `bin/assert-suite`, and
the SSRF table gets its own 62-test run so the log carries a line that can only
exist if that harness ran. **When you add or delete a test, raise the floor in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` in the same commit.** Deleting a test to make CI green
is caught by the floor; adding one is caught because CI goes red until you raise
it. Both are one-line diffs, and only one of them changes what courier verifies.

**A backup configuration nobody reaches is a document.** `config/kamal-backup.yml`
is read by no process in this repository: the only reference to it anywhere is one
`files:` line in `config/deploy.yml`, mounting it into the `backup` accessory at
`/app/config/kamal-backup.yml`, which is where `kamal-backup` opens it. Delete
that line and the file is still valid, still careful, and inert — the same defect
one layer down as not having written it. So `Courier.BackupConfigTest` reads
**both** files: the mount exists, and every secret the backup config names is in
the accessory's `env.secret` list. That second one is not a convention: the
`kamal-backup validate` builds the accessory's environment from that list and
from nothing else, so a secret named in one file and missing from the other is a
valid file in each and a **rejected pair** — measured on kamal-backup 0.5.2,
which reports `RESTIC_REPOSITORY or RESTIC_REPOSITORY_FILE is required`. The
rule is one-directional on purpose: every secret named in the backup config is in
the accessory, and the accessory holds two more (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) because `ConfigFile::TOP_LEVEL_KEYS` has no key for an
AWS credential at all. A check demanding the two files name the same set would be
wrong in the direction of failing on correct configuration.

**`config/kamal-backup.yml` is RENDERED, and the `.erb` is not what ships.** kit
ships `templates/kamal/kamal-backup.yml.erb`; what lands here is its rendered
output, with `app:` a literal. Kamal evaluates ERB in `config/deploy.yml` because
Kamal owns that file; `kamal-backup` does not — `KamalBackup::ConfigFile#data`
reads the path with `YAML.safe_load` and nothing else. An unrendered
`app: <%= service %>` is therefore *not a syntax error*: YAML reads it as a
literal scalar, and the failure is a repository full of snapshots under
`databases/<%= service %>/primary/`, tagged `app:<%= service %>`, which no
`kamal-backup list` filtered on this app ever finds. The test asserts the absence
of a tag **on the lines the tool reads**, because this file's own header quotes the
tag while explaining the failure.

**"Nothing on local disk" is a claim about courier's COLUMNS, and it is asserted
from the schema.** `config/kamal-backup.yml` has no `paths:` key, so no restic
file snapshot is ever taken (`latest_file_backup: null` in `evidence` is correct,
not a gap). That is only defensible while courier stores nothing outside Postgres,
so `Courier.BackupTablesTest` reads `information_schema` on every run and fails if
a column appears holding file bytes or pointing at bytes held elsewhere. The one
permitted `bytea` is `idempotency_keys.response_body` — a cached response body
*inside* Postgres, expired on a clock — and the one thing that check must never
become is "there is a bytea column, therefore there are files".

**The SecretBox key cannot be in the backup, and that is the answer rather than a
gap.** `webhook_endpoints.secret` is sealed under `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`, and
`config/runtime.exs` refuses to boot without it — so it is not in the database and
cannot be in a dump of the database. **A restore brings every signing secret back
as ciphertext, and courier cannot read its own rows until that key is supplied
unchanged.** The rows come back; the ability to sign with them does not. Hence
`COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY` is asserted ABSENT from both the backup config and the
accessory's secret list, and asserted PRESENT in `config/runtime.exs` — an absence
with nothing on the other side of it is a boundary that deletes everything. The
same shape applies to `RESTIC_PASSWORD`: lose it and every snapshot in the
repository is permanently unreadable, including the ones not yet lost.

**A scheduled dump is not PITR, and the number is measured from when the previous
backup FINISHED.** With the shipped `schedule: 1d`, up to **24 hours** of
committed transactions are lost if the database is destroyed — not to a wall-clock
deadline. The scheduler's loop is *run a backup, then sleep the interval*, so one
cycle is the interval **plus that run's duration**, and `pg_dump` takes its
snapshot at the **start** of the dump, so the gap between two snapshot points is
that whole cycle and is never exactly 24 hours. A failed backup is not retried
until the next interval either; the loop logs and sleeps. `Courier.BackupConfigTest`
reads `schedule:` from the config and asserts README quotes the matching window,
so changing the cadence without changing the README goes red.

**`config/deploy.yml` is kit's template with courier's facts, and the differences
are three — two changes and one absence.** Copied from
`templates/kamal/deploy.yml.erb` at kit d201080: (1) the proxy healthcheck path is
`/readyz`, because `CourierWeb.Router` serves `/healthz` and `/readyz` and nothing
else, so kit's `/up` would 404 on every probe and `kamal deploy` would tear back
every rollout after `deploy_timeout` on a release that is otherwise fine;
(2) `env.secret` carries courier's own boot-required variables, read off
`config/runtime.exs`'s `raise`s rather than from memory. The third is an ABSENCE:
neither file has `migrate:`, so **`bin/migrate` is not run by a `kamal deploy`.**
Kamal 2.12.0 rejects the key outright (`Kamal::ConfigurationError: unknown key:
migrate`, measured with the real binary) and runs migrations from
`.kamal/hooks/pre-deploy`. That hook is courier's own file to add and this
repository has not added it, because silently changing what a deploy does is the
thing these rules keep refusing.

Re-measure both, and **re-measure the labels rather than only the floors.** The
suppression packet added 31 database tests and nobody raised this file: the
*floor* stayed green because it is a decrease detector, while the number printed
beside it quietly stopped describing the tree for a whole packet. A floor that
cannot catch it is not the same thing as a comment that cannot be stale, and only
one of the two is a gate.

**A test asserts about its own rows, never about the table's.** A count over the
whole table — `Repo.aggregate(WebhookEndpoint, :count) == 0` — is a claim about
every other test in the repository as much as about the code under test: it is
green only while nothing else has ever written a row, and red the moment one is
visible. That is the *test-level* shape of the tenant-isolation weakness D18
tracks, and it failed in about one run in nine until courier-15 gave each of the
six affected tests its own tenancy key and counted only its own account's rows.
The rule generalises past those six: **mint an account per test that needs to
assert nothing was written, and count that account.** The same reasoning covers
reads: a `Repo.all/1` with no `order_by` returns rows in PostgreSQL's order, not
insertion order, so an assertion that compares two lists must sort both sides
before it is a claim about courier rather than about the server's whim.

**The toolchain is pinned in `mise.toml` and nowhere else.** `bin/toolchain-pins`
is how CI reads it, so the workflow cannot disagree with the worktree; the one
unavoidable duplicate is kit's `versions:` input, and `bin/toolchain-pins
--check` fails when that line and `mise.toml` stop matching. Bump both or neither.

**`mix.lock` must not move when the gate runs.** A prime that resolves
differently is a prime that lets two worktrees disagree about one commit, and the
suite cannot see it. CI runs `git diff --exit-code -- mix.lock` after `bin/prime`.

**`async: false` is a comment, not a shrug.** If your test stops or restarts a
process the suite shares — `Courier.Repo`, the endpoint, the Oban queue — it must
be `async: false` and say why in a comment above `use`. The same goes for a test
that changes application env, which the whole VM shares: those live in their own
`*ConfigTest` file, as `ProcessOutboxWorkerConfigTest`,
`WebhookEndpointsConfigTest` and `DeliverWebhookWorkerBudgetTest` do.

**`openapi.yaml` and the router are held to each other by a test, in both
directions.** `test/courier_web/openapi_document_test.exs` reads the document and
`CourierWeb.Router.__routes__/0` and fails if they disagree — an operation in the
document the router does not serve, *or* a route the router serves the document
does not describe. Both are failures, not warnings: a warning nobody acts on is a
note in a file nobody reads, and PLAN.md MD6 has the platform generating client
SDKs from this document, so an omission here is a method a generated client will
not have. The only omission is `/healthz` and `/readyz`, named in the document's
header and in the test's exclusion list with the reason, and the test fails if
that list stops naming a route the router serves.

It compares **paths**, never counts: a count comparison passes on a rename and
fails on an addition, which is backwards. The readers raise rather than
under-read, because a document reader that finds nothing and a router reader that
finds nothing agree with each other, and a green check over nothing is worse than
no check. **A route added to `router.ex` is not finished until it is in
`openapi.yaml`, and an operation added to `openapi.yaml` is not finished until
the router serves it.** The only omission is `/healthz` and `/readyz`, named in
the document's header and in the test's exclusion list with the reason, and the
test fails if that list stops naming a route the router serves.

Every operation in that document requires a bearer token, including the two
notification-preferences operations, which stopped being the exception in
courier-16. `openapi_error_responses_test.exs` works out which operations must
declare a 401 by **provoking** them rather than from a list, so it is the check
that noticed; a `security:` key or a status written down in the test would each
have kept asserting the old thing and gone green.

**A preference is the user's, and the account is who owns it.**
`notification_preferences.account_id` is written from the principal and never from
a request, and the unique index stays on `(user_id, notification_type)` — one
answer per person, not one per account, which is what lets `enabled?/3` (the
delivery path, and it takes no account) keep reading by user alone. Two
consequences are load-bearing and both are asserted:

  * **A 404 is the only cross-tenant answer, and it is narrow.** A user nobody
    has written preferences for is a 200 with the defaults, because courier holds
    no foreign key to identity's users and cannot tell that user from one that
    does not exist. The 404 appears only once a row exists and belongs to another
    account, and never a 403 — see the rule above on leaking existence.
  * **The first authenticated `PUT` for a user id claims it.** courier cannot ask
    identity which account a user belongs to, so whoever writes first records the
    owning account. An account that writes for an unwritten user id therefore
    gains the claim — no access to anything that existed, and the real owner then
    gets a 404. That is a real limitation rather than a design, and it is why the
    migration that added the column **deletes** every row written through the
    unauthenticated routes instead of backfilling a guess: an unattributable
    opt-out is either visible to every tenant or to none, and "to none" fails in
    the direction courier's own rule demands, *silence is not consent*.

**A retryable `POST` claims its `Idempotency-Key` before it does the work, and
only a 2xx is kept.** The ordering is the whole mechanism: a key recorded after
the action cannot prevent anything, so `Courier.Idempotency.claim/1` runs in the
plug and the response is stored in `before_send`, with the row sitting in
`in_flight` between the two. Two properties follow and both are load-bearing:
**a request that did not succeed releases its key** rather than storing the
failure — a stored 422 would pin a caller's typo for 24 hours, and a stored 500
would pin a courier blip for the same day — and **`endpoint` is the concrete
request path**, not the route pattern, so a client that reuses one key to test
four endpoints is not refused on the second.

Two Elixir traps sit under this and are written into `CourierWeb.Plugs.Idempotency`
and `Courier.Idempotency` rather than left in this file alone, because both fail
**silently**: `conn.resp_body` inside `before_send` is **iodata, not a binary**
(`Phoenix.Controller.json/2` encodes to iodata and `Plug.Conn` stores what it is
given), and Ecto's keyword `where/2` **does not apply the schema's field type**,
so a `DateTime` compared against a `utc_datetime_usec` column matches nothing.
Use the `where([k], ...)` macro form and `IO.iodata_to_binary/1`.

**The inbound path verifies before it parses, and that order is the security
property.** `Courier.Suppressions.ingest/1` was written, tested, documented as
"the HTTP surface's entry point" — and nothing called it, so the suppression
table was only ever written by tests and a customer who hard-bounced was mailed
again forever. The obvious way to give it a caller is a route that
`Jason.decode!`s a body and passes it in, and that route is an unauthenticated
`POST` that records suppressions: anyone who finds the URL can suppress anyone's
mail, which is a denial of service on the whole product delivered by the feature
meant to protect it. So `Courier.Inbound.handle/5` verifies first and parses
only on `:ok`, and `test/courier/inbound_test.exs` drives the real
`Courier.Suppressions` against the real `email_suppressions` table and asserts
**no row exists** afterwards. It is a `Courier.DataCase` for that reason alone: a
mock would make "the parser refused" and "the row is absent" the same claim. A
negative assertion is paired with a positive one throughout, because a boundary
that records nothing ever passes every "records nothing" test.

**The verifier's correctness is pinned to a vector the PROVIDER published, not to
courier's own signer.** `Courier.Webhooks.Verifier`'s moduledoc says courier is a
producer and "nothing here receives webhooks"; Resend signs with Svix, which is
the scheme Standard Webhooks was standardised from, so `Courier.Inbound.Signature`
reuses `Courier.Webhooks.Signature` rather than reimplementing the crypto — and
`test/courier/inbound/signature_test.exs` leads with Svix's own worked example
from <https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual>, because
"a test that asserted the signer against itself would pass even if the base
string were wrong". Resend's own verification page prints a signature whose
secret it never shows (`process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET`); measured, it is NOT the
HMAC of the body printed beside it, and the test file records that rather than
building a fixture on a coincidence. Two rules that look like details and are not:
the signing secret is checked **before** any header, so a courier deployed without
one reports its own misconfiguration on every request rather than an attacker's
missing header; and `:crypto.hash_equals/2` is called behind a `byte_size` guard,
because it **raises** `ArgumentError` on a length mismatch and an unguarded call
turns "POST a 4-character signature" into a 500. **The constant-time comparison
is the one claim no behavioural test can catch** — mutating `hash_equals` to `==`
left the suite at 108/108 green — so it is asserted on the source, and the test
says why a timing test would be worse than useless.

**A provider payload written from memory is indistinguishable from a correct one
until the provider's real bytes arrive**, and by then it is in production rows.
Every payload in `resend_test.exs` is copied from a named
`resend.com/docs/...` page. Two things that reading the docs changed: the bounce
vocabulary is `Permanent` / `Transient` / `Undetermined` on one page and
`Permanent` / `Temporary` on another, so **both** soft spellings are accepted and
`Undetermined` is deliberately soft — being told there was a bounce is not being
told the mailbox is gone, and `Courier.Suppressions` already states the asymmetry
("being wrong towards sending is expensive and cumulative"). And
`provider_event_id` is `"<type>/<email_id>:<address>"`, all three parts, because
a **broadcast shares one `email_id` across every recipient**: keyed on the email
alone, four of five bounces collide with the first and four live mailboxes go on
being mailed forever. The `email.complained/` prefix is load-bearing for the same
reason from the other side — measured, a complaint about an address that had
already hard-bounced collided with the bounce's row, the unique index returned
`duplicate`, and the `:suppressed` row was never written, inverting the one
precedence rule `Courier.Suppressions` exists to make unbreakable.

**An event courier cannot classify is refused, not defaulted.**
`{:error, :unsupported_event}` for a `type` courier has not read, and
`{:error, {:unknown_bounce_type, value}}` for a bounce type outside the documented
set — the same fail-closed choice as `Courier.ErrorReporting.Filter` returning nil
rather than emitting what it cannot redact. A provider that adds an event type
should produce a log line, not silence. The distinction that matters: a KNOWN
value meaning "the provider does not know" (`Undetermined`) is classified, and an
UNKNOWN value is a refusal.

**A webhook signature is not courier's to invent.** PLAN.md §7 adopted [Standard
Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com) and said "No custom scheme", which
means the base string is `msg_id.timestamp.payload`, the headers are
`webhook-id` / `webhook-timestamp` / `webhook-signature`, and a consumer can
verify a delivery with an official library without learning anything about
courier. `moon/refs/standard-webhooks/spec/standard-webhooks.md` is the authority;
cite the section in the moduledoc when you touch any of it. Renaming a header or
"improving" the base string breaks every customer integration at once, and the
only way to find out is from them.

**The signed bytes are the sent bytes.** The spec is explicit that re-serializing
a payload between signing and sending invalidates the signature. Encode once,
sign that binary, send that binary.

**Every URL a customer gives courier passes `Courier.Webhooks.UrlGuard` before
it is stored, and the address the sender dials is the one the guard checked.**
courier will HMAC a request to an attacker-chosen URL, so this is the difference
between a webhook sender and an SSRF proxy. The guard resolves the host, refuses
the URL if *any* answer is a blocked address, and returns the resolved address —
not the name — so there is no second, unchecked lookup. If you add a way to set an
endpoint's URL anywhere else, run the guard there too; a table full of
`169.254.169.254` for whatever reads it first is the failure mode.

**A signing secret is never in the database in the clear.** `Courier.SecretBox`
seals it with AES-256-GCM under `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`, and the plaintext exists
in exactly two places: the single `201` that hands it to the customer, and the
process signing with it. The tests read the column as raw SQL for that reason.
A hash is not an option here — courier has to sign *with* the bytes.

**A retry budget is bounded and visible, and there are two of them.**
`config :courier, :webhooks` holds `max_attempts` (per delivery) and
`circuit_threshold` (per endpoint), plus the backoff base, cap and jitter
divisor. PLAN.md §7 forbids naive retries, which means the numbers live in
configuration an operator can read, not in a constant inside a worker.

**Nothing sleeps.** The backoff schedule is asserted on the recorded
`next_attempt_at` and on `backoff/1`'s return value. A test that waits for a
five-minute window is a test that takes five minutes, and one that lowers the
window to make it fast is a test that stopped checking the schedule.

**An authorization decision is a 404, not a 403, for anything the caller cannot
see.** Core's `docs/openapi-conventions.md` says 403 "leaks existence". The
account comes from `conn.assigns.current_account`, never from a request body —
`CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal` is a seam with a refusing default, so a courier
without identity's JWT verifier is locked rather than open.

**The door has a key now, and the key is `account_id`.** `Courier.Principal.
Introspection` is what `config :courier, :principal` names outside test: it reads
the caller's token from `Authorization: Bearer` and asks identity
`POST /v1/introspections`. The token is **opaque** — `cafaye_` plus random bytes,
SHA-256 in the row — so there is no claim to read locally and no key to verify
against, and asking identity is the only way to learn an `account_id`. Four rules
came out of writing it, and each is a place the obvious version is wrong:

  * **`account_id` is the only tenancy key and there is no `sub` fallback.**
    `sub` is the *user* a token names. `Document.account_id/1` uses
    `Map.fetch/2` **with no default argument**, which is what makes the fallback
    inexpressible in the one function that decides the account — and the subject
    is read two functions below and is a perfectly good uuid, which is exactly
    why a `||` would be so easy to write by accident. A document that is active
    and carries no `account_id` is `:error` (a 401), because a token courier
    cannot place is a caller courier cannot serve. An `account_id` that is
    *present and malformed* is `{:error, :unreadable}` (a 503), because identity
    said something courier does not understand, and reporting that as an answer
    is how courier ends up logging somebody in as the account `"not-a-uuid"`.
  * **One answer for every unusable token.** Unknown, revoked, expired and
    orphaned all arrive as `200 {"active": false}` and courier does not
    re-expand them. There is no branch on `exp`, no clock, and no `revoked`
    claim anywhere in `Document` — the structural reason the four cannot come
    apart. `identity`'s `mayIntrospect` runs the standing check *after* the
    token resolves, so an unknown token is inactive for everybody.
  * **Both scope claim names are read, and neither is assumed absent.** `scopes`
    and `scope` are emitted byte for byte because the fleet has not agreed on
    one (MD7, open in the manager's `DECISIONS.md`): core requires `scopes`,
    guard reads `scope`. courier reads the union. A claim that is present and is
    **not a string** is `{:error, :unreadable}` rather than an empty set — the
    array is the shape a losing side of MD7 could adopt, and reading it as "no
    scopes" is the silent version of that bug. The clause order matters: `:error`
    before the malformed clause, because a bare `_absent` variable matches
    everything after it. That was a real bug, caught by a test.
  * **`scopes` is parsed and deliberately NOT enforced.** `Courier.Principal`
    gained a `scopes` field and nothing reads it to make a decision, and that is
    a decision with a **measured** reason: identity's vocabulary is a closed set
    of six (`accounts:read`, `accounts:write`, `accounts:delete`,
    `oidc_clients:write`, `audit_log:read`, `account_invitations:write`), and
    **not one of the five scopes `openapi.yaml` declares** (`webhooks:read`,
    `webhooks:write`, `notifications:read`, `notifications:write`,
    `messages:write`) can be minted by it. A scope check written today would
    refuse every credential identity is able to issue. What courier enforces is
    tenancy. `openapi.yaml`'s `bearerAuth` says all of this where a client author
    reads it.

**Authentication is a network hop, so a dependency failure is a 503 and not a
401.** Every operation behind the plug can now answer `503`: identity
unreachable, slow, erroring, **or answering 401/403**, or answering in a shape
courier cannot read. Two of those are load-bearing and neither is obvious:

  * **identity's own 401 and 403 are courier's problem, not the caller's.**
    identity answers 401 when the credential *courier* presented is not one it
    accepts, and 403 when that credential may not ask about the token it named
    (`mayIntrospect`: a token caller may read *itself* and nothing else). Both
    are facts about this deployment. Reporting either as a 401 tells a customer
    to rotate a token that was never the problem, and an operator reads a wall
    of "invalid credentials" when the fault is one environment variable.
  * **A 200 courier cannot read is also a 503.** `Document.from/1` returns
    `{:error, :unreadable}` for that, and only an explicit `{"active": false}`
    is the `:error` that becomes a 401. A document that fails to *say* a token is
    usable has not said the token is unusable.

The alternative was to let the request through when identity cannot be reached,
and that is the thing this rule exists to prevent: a resolver that fails OPEN
under load is worse than `Reject`, because it fails *silently*. So is "no answer
means the session is still valid" — a caching temptation this repository refuses,
because a cached introspection answer is a revocation that has not taken effect
yet and the answer courier would serve from it is `account_id`. **There is no
cache**, and the cost is stated rather than assumed: courier's latency includes
identity's, and identity's outage is courier's outage.

**`{503, :unavailable}` is a third answer, and `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal`
learned it.** `Courier.Principal.Resolver.answer` was `{:ok, principal} |
:error`, which was enough for a resolver that either knows or does not. A
resolver that has to **ask somebody** has a third case, and the plug is the only
place that can write the response, so it gained exactly one clause. **The 401
branch is untouched and that is a test, not a promise**:
`principal_config_test.exs` drives the same request through both resolvers and
asserts the two 401 envelopes are equal field for field — `type`, `code`,
`status`, `title`, `detail`, `instance` — dropping `trace_id` **by name** rather
than by a rule, because that field is per request by design and comparing two
requests' identities would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the plug.
Every `/v1` operation now declares the 503 in `openapi.yaml`, and the header
says why; the document test holds it to the router in both directions, reading
the operation set out of `Phoenix.Router.route_info/4` rather than a list.

**What courier presents to introspect is `COURIER_IDENTITY_TOKEN`, and that was a
judgement call rather than an accident.** It is courier's own scoped API token,
in the environment, never in argv (anything on a command line is in `ps` output
and in a shell history) and never in a committed config file. It is never
logged and never part of a reason: every refusal is a symbol, and
`introspection_test.exs` captures real log output and asserts it is ABSENT —
which is the assertion worth more than "it logged something", because a boundary
that deletes everything passes that. **Rotation is identity's**: mint, redeploy,
revoke; nothing is cached to invalidate. `config/runtime.exs` **refuses to boot**
without it in prod, on the same rule as `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`: a resolver with
no credential authenticates nobody, and discovering that at boot is cheaper than
discovering it from a support ticket.

**RFC 7662 §2.1 lets courier forward the caller's own token, and courier does
not.** identity implements that affordance — "a token may introspect **itself**"
— so forwarding would need no second secret at all. It covers **only the token
identity is holding**, so any other tenant's token is a 403: a door shut for
every real tenant and open for exactly the one account that owns courier's own
service token. That is the worst shape a credential can have, so courier presents
its own and **reports identity's 403 as a 503** rather than pretending a tenant
can authenticate. The contract gap is in the packet report, not fixed here.

**No credential appears in argv, in a committed file, or in a log, and the whole
class of leaks here starts with a *body*.** `introspection_test.exs` asserts the
caller's token, courier's own token, and the account id are all absent from
captured output. `Transport.Req` sets `decode_body: false` so **courier** decodes
the answer, in `Document`, where the rules about what an unreadable answer means
are written down — `Req`'s default decoder hands back a map, `to_string/1` on a
map raises `String.Chars`, and the first draft did exactly that. The 2s
`receive_timeout`, `retry: false`, `redirect: false` and `max_redirects: 0` are
merged AFTER `:introspection_req_options` so nothing in `config/` can switch
them off: they are decisions, not settings.

**A request with no bearer is refused WITHOUT calling identity.** Not an
optimisation — an unauthenticated endpoint that dials a dependency per request
is a load generator pointed at identity by anybody who finds courier's URL. And
the test resolver's `x-courier-account` header is ignored by this resolver, which
is asserted over a real resolver call rather than left as a convention: a header
that becomes a fast path is an authentication bypass with a config file attached.

**A seam is tested from both sides or it is not tested.** The resolver's tests run
against `Courier.TestSupport.IntrospectionTransport`, a table; the shipped
`Transport.Req` runs against Req's own `plug: {Req.Test, …}`. A suite that only
ever answers from a table proves nothing about the request courier really builds,
and the symptom of a wrong header or path is a 403 from identity that looks
exactly like a misconfigured credential. The stub is registered in `setup`, not
`setup_all`: `Req.Test` uses nimble_ownership, and a stub set in `setup_all`
belongs to a process that has exited by the time the first test runs.

**Nothing sleeps, including the introspection dial's own budget.** The 2s timeout
is asserted as a number on `Transport.Req.receive_timeout_ms/0` rather than as
the fact that one exists, and no test waits for it.

**One span-attribute allowlist, in `Courier.Observability`, and it is a
choke point rather than a convention.** Every attribute courier records goes
through `Courier.Observability.record/2`, which drops anything not on the list;
the list is projected from `core/schemas/telemetry/*.schema.json`. That is the
whole defence, and its realistic failure is not an attacker — it is a
well-meaning engineer in six months adding `record(span, %{"courier.payload" =>
params})` because it would help debug a delivery, in the one service in the
fleet whose payloads are other customers' data. So:

  * **Do not call `span.set_attribute/3` directly.** There is one recorder and
    it filters. A `set_attribute` on a span courier owns bypasses the allowlist
    by exactly as much as the engine will later strip — which is to say it
    succeeds.
  * **`http.route` is the route TEMPLATE**, from `Phoenix.Router.route_info/4`,
    never `conn.request_path`. A template has one value per endpoint; a concrete
    path has one per request, and kit's collector derives metrics with a
    `spanmetrics` connector that mints a series per distinct value. A 404
    therefore carries **no** route at all: the path there is caller-controlled
    text, which is both the cardinality bomb and the content leak in one move.
  * **4xx is not an error span.** Only 5xx is. A 401 or a 404 is courier
    refusing, which is courier working; an error rate that counts it is a
    function of how much guessing the platform absorbs, and an alert on it pages
    somebody to switch off the protection doing its job.
  * **No `tenant_id` on a span.** It is a resource attribute, and
    `test/courier/telemetry_test.exs` holds the resource's own shape.

`test/courier/telemetry_canary_test.exs` is the proof and it is not optional: it
plants a canary in every field a caller controls — path, query, headers, body —
drives real requests through the real router, and raises
`THE REDACTION BOUNDARY LEAKED` if it finds one in anything exported. **Every
absence assertion in that file is paired with a presence one**, because a
redaction boundary that deletes everything passes "no canary" and is useless:
three separate bugs left this suite green with nothing exported at all (an
exporter implementing `export/3` where the callback is `export/4`; an `init/1`
returning `:ok` where `{:ok, state}` was required; a `record/2` guarded on
`is_map(span)` when a span is a record). `Courier.TestSpans.rendered!/0` raises
rather than returning an empty string so that shape cannot recur silently.

**Metrics come from the collector's `spanmetrics` connector, not from courier.**
`ls deps/opentelemetry/src | grep -c metric` is `0` — the Erlang SDK ships no
metrics API at all — so there is no second implementation to be inconsistent
with kit's, and no risk of two series with the same name and different
definitions. It also runs *after* redaction, which means a derived metric can
never carry a dimension the allowlist stripped. The cost is honest and worth
stating: courier cannot emit a gauge, so **a stalled outbox relay is invisible
on the metrics signal** and shows up only as a flat trace count.

## Environment

`DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `PHX_HOST`, as any Phoenix release needs,
plus one this packet added:

- **`COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`** — 32 bytes, base64, the key every webhook signing
  secret is sealed under (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Required in prod and
  never defaulted: a default would be a key in version control that every
  deployment which forgot to set one would seal its customers' credentials
  under. `config/test.exs` sets a fixed one; losing the production key means
  every stored secret has to be re-issued, because the plaintext cannot be
  recovered from the ciphertext.

And one this packet added for observability, which is optional everywhere:

- **`COURIER_OTEL_ENDPOINT`** — the OTLP endpoint, defaulted to
  `http://otel-collector:4318`, which is the collector that ships with kit's
  stack (core D16: this variable is the only contract, and the collector is
  just its default value). Point it at anything speaking OTLP and courier goes
  there instead; unset it and courier exports into a collector that is not
  running, which costs spans and nothing else — there is no queue, no retry loop
  and no dial at boot. `COURIER_TENANT_ID` and `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` are
  resource attributes, not measurements, and both are unset by default.
  `config/runtime.exs` guards the whole block with `config_env() != :test`: that
  guard is load-bearing, because `runtime.exs` runs *after* `test.exs` and an
  unguarded line would replace the suite's in-memory exporter with a real one —
  and every redaction test asserts the **absence** of a canary, so with nothing
  exporting they would all go green having proved nothing.

And eight from the provider adapter, all read from `config/runtime.exs` by
`Courier.MailerAdapter`, **required in every environment including test** and
never committed to a config file. Only the four with a correct default are
defaulted (`COURIER_SMTP_PORT` 587, `COURIER_SMTP_AUTH` and `COURIER_SMTP_TLS`
`always`, `COURIER_SMTP_SSL` `false`); the adapter itself is required, because an
adapter with a default is wrong for exactly the deployments nobody is watching.

And two from the door, read by `Courier.Principal.Introspection`, where **the
asymmetry between them is the decision**:

- **`COURIER_IDENTITY_TOKEN`** — courier's own scoped API token, presented as the
  `Authorization` header on identity's introspection call. **Required in prod,
  never defaulted, and refused at boot**: a default would be a credential in
  version control that every deployment which forgot one would authenticate
  callers with. Mint one with `POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/api-keys` in an
  account that belongs to courier and to nothing else; rotate by minting a new
  one, redeploying and revoking the old — there is no cache to invalidate.
  `config/test.exs` sets a fixed one, on the same terms as
  `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`.
- **`COURIER_IDENTITY_URL`** — identity's base URL, defaulted to
  `http://identity:4000` (the compose-network name, and the same shape as
  `COURIER_OTEL_ENDPOINT`'s default). A wrong URL is a **503 on every
  authenticated request**: loud, diagnosable and retriable — which is why
  making a dependency's address a boot requirement would turn "identity moved"
  into a stop-the-world upgrade gate for a service that is otherwise fine.

- **`COURIER_MAIL_ADAPTER`** — `smtp`, the only adapter courier ships. `none` is
  `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` and is **refused in production**. Unset is a boot
  failure, not a fallback to `none`. A module name is not a value: the variable
  names a provider from a fixed set, so `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` cannot be spelled
  here even if somebody wants it to.
- **`COURIER_SMTP_HOST`** — required when the adapter is `smtp`.
- **`COURIER_SMTP_USERNAME`** / **`COURIER_SMTP_PASSWORD`** — required unless
  `COURIER_SMTP_AUTH=never`, because `gen_smtp` refuses `auth: :always` without
  both halves at the socket, and a per-send failure there is the same defect one
  layer out.
- **`COURIER_SMTP_AUTH`** — `always` (default), `never`, `if_available`.
- **`COURIER_SMTP_TLS`** — `always` (default), `never`, `if_available`.
- **`COURIER_SMTP_SSL`** — `false` by default; `true` for implicit TLS, usually
  on 465.

An empty string counts as **unset** for all of them: `SMTP_PASSWORD=` in a compose
file produces `""`, and an empty password sent to a provider comes back as a 535
the operator has no way to explain. Losing `COURIER_MAIL_ADAPTER` means courier
does not start, which is the point — it is the cheapest possible way to find out,
and it happens before the first customer mail rather than after a support ticket.

For templates, without a relay: `COURIER_MAIL_ADAPTER=none mix phx.server`.

## Toolchain

mise, from `mise.toml`: `mise install`, then `mise run prime` for the gate.
For container work: `docker compose up --build` starts postgres:17-alpine and the
release image, and `docker compose down -v` throws the volume away.

## Generated rules

Everything below this line is the Phoenix 1.8 generator's own guidance, kept
between its `usage-rules` markers so `mix phx.new` upgrades can replace it. The
HTML, LiveView, Tailwind, and icon rules are inert here — courier has no HTML
layer — but the Elixir, Mix, Test, and Ecto rules all apply.

This is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework.

## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps

### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
custom classes must fully style the input


<!-- usage-rules-start -->

<!-- phoenix:elixir-start -->
## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason

## Test guidelines

- **Always use `start_supervised!/1`** to start processes in tests as it guarantees cleanup between tests
- **Avoid** `Process.sleep/1` and `Process.alive?/1` in tests
  - Instead of sleeping to wait for a process to finish, **always** use `Process.monitor/1` and assert on the DOWN message:

      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, :normal}

   - Instead of sleeping to synchronize before the next call, **always** use `_ = :sys.get_state/1` to ensure the process has handled prior messages
<!-- phoenix:elixir-end -->

<!-- phoenix:phoenix-start -->
## Phoenix guidelines

- Remember Phoenix router `scope` blocks include an optional alias which is prefixed for all routes within the scope. **Always** be mindful of this when creating routes within a scope to avoid duplicate module prefixes.

- You **never** need to create your own `alias` for route definitions! The `scope` provides the alias, ie:

      scope "/admin", AppWeb.Admin do
        pipe_through :browser

        live "/users", UserLive, :index
      end

  the UserLive route would point to the `AppWeb.Admin.UserLive` module

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it
<!-- phoenix:phoenix-end -->

<!-- phoenix:ecto-start -->
## Ecto Guidelines

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed in templates, ie a message that needs to reference the `message.user.email`
- Remember `import Ecto.Query` and other supporting modules when you write `seeds.exs`
- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text`, columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such as option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programmatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls or similar for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct
- **Always** invoke `mix ecto.gen.migration migration_name_using_underscores` when generating migration files, so the correct timestamp and conventions are applied
