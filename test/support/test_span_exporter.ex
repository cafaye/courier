defmodule Courier.TestSpanExporter do
  @moduledoc """
  An in-memory OTLP exporter, so a test can read the spans courier produced.

  NOT A MOCK. This is the real OpenTelemetry SDK with its real exporter replaced
  by one that copies the finished spans into a table the test owns. What the test
  reads is the payload an operator's collector would have received — span names,
  attribute names, attribute values, statuses, resources and all. Asserting on a
  hand-built map would prove the TEST's idea of the payload is correct, which is
  not the property under test.

  In a table rather than in the test process, and that is not tidiness: the SDK
  exports on the process that ended the span, which in a Phoenix endpoint is a
  Bandit connection process, not the test. A message to the test process would
  need a registered owner per test, and an owner that outlives its test is a
  message to a dead pid.

  ## Why this file is fussier than it looks

  Three things about the SDK's exporter interface are not guessable, and each was
  got wrong first. All three fail in the SAME way — silently — and that is what
  makes them worth writing down.

    1. `init/1` must return `{:ok, state}` or `:ignore`. `otel_exporter:init/1`
       matches `try ExporterModule:init(Config) of {ok, State} -> …; ignore -> …
       end` with NO catch-all, so a bare `:ok` is a TryClauseError inside a
       gen_statem. The processor is then dropped by
       `otel_tracer_server:init_processor/3` with a log at `info`.
    2. `export/4`, not `export/3`. The callback is
       `export(signal, table, resource, config)`; an `export/3` is not a callback
       at all, so it is never called and every span is discarded.
    3. The second argument is an ETS TABLE the processor owns, not a list of
       spans, and the rows are still in it at that moment.

  Each of those leaves the suite GREEN. "No canary reached a span" is true of a
  span that was never exported, so a broken exporter makes every redaction
  assertion in this repository pass, in about a second, having proved nothing.
  That is why every canary test here pairs its absence assertion with a PRESENCE
  assertion, and why `rendered!/0` refuses to return an empty string.

  The error that gives it away is at `info` and names the module:

      [warning] Exporter module Courier.TestSpanExporter not found.

  A watermark: the value to pass to `take_since/1` to read only what comes next.

  WHY, and it is not tidiness. The suite is mostly `async: true` and every request
  through the endpoint exports a span into THIS table, so a test that clears the
  table and then reads it is reading whatever any other test happened to export
  while it was working. The first version did exactly that and failed with
  "expected exactly one exported span, got 8" — eight being every request the rest
  of the suite had made in the meantime.

  An earlier version avoided it with `clear/1`, which is worse: clearing a shared
  table is a test deleting another test's evidence, so two tests asserting the same
  time pass or fail depending on the scheduler. A watermark reads only what this
  test produced, and leaves everyone else's alone.

  Forget everything.
