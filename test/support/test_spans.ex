defmodule Courier.TestSpans do
  @moduledoc """
  The spans courier actually produced, read out of the export path.

  ## Why this goes through an exporter at all

  The Erlang OpenTelemetry SDK cannot start a span processor, in any published
  version, for reasons that are in `Courier.SpanCollector` and reproduced there in
  two commands. So the redaction tests could not have read a collector-bound
  export even if courier's wiring were the SDK's own — which means reading the
  table directly was the obvious alternative and it is WRONG:

  `otel_span_ets:end_span/3` does `ets:take(SPAN_TAB, SpanId)` and hands the
  record to the on-end processor list. The row is destroyed on the way out. There
  is no "finished spans" table to read; there is a queue that the processor is
  supposed to drain.

  So the tests go through the same route a deployment does — courier's own
  `Courier.SpanCollector` calling the exporter — which is also the stronger claim.
  It is not "courier put these attributes on a span"; it is "these are the
  attributes that left courier".

  ## Why every absence assertion here is paired with a presence one

  A redaction boundary that deletes all attributes is indistinguishable from a
  working one when the only assertion is that a canary is missing, and it is
  useless in production. `rendered!/0` refuses to return an empty string for
  exactly that reason, so a suite in which courier exported nothing fails loudly
  rather than passing quietly.

  # The SDK's `#span{}` field order, declared ONCE and used to build the index map
  # below.
  #
  # Not `Record.extract/2`, which reads a header from `_build/<env>/lib/<app>/
  # include/` — a path rebar3 does not produce for a Mix dependency, so the first
  # version raised `enoent`. And not `record[:field]`, which is what reads most
  # naturally: `Access` resolves a field name only for a MAP, so on an Erlang
  # record it raises a FunctionClauseError. Hence `elem/2` with indices derived
  # from this one list, so there is a single place where the order is written down
  # and a second place that would notice it being wrong.
  #
  # The offset is 1, not 2: the record TAG occupies element 0, so `trace_id` —
  # the first declared field — is `elem/2` index 1. Getting that wrong reads
  # `kind` as `name` and reports a span called "server", which is how the mistake
  # was caught the first time.

  Rendered rather than compared key-by-key, and that is the whole design. A
  key-by-key assertion only catches a leak through a key the test already knew to
  look for; rendering catches a leak through a VALUE as well, and through a key
  nobody predicted. The leak this file exists to prevent arrives as a new attribute
  name, and a test that asserts on the names it knows about goes green on the day
  the new name is added.
