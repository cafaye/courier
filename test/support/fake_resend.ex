defmodule Courier.TestSupport.FakeResend do
  @moduledoc """
  A Resend that signs, so a test can drive courier's inbound path end to end
  without a provider, a network, or a secret an operator has to provision.

  Worker B and worker C both need this: B writes the event builders, C writes the
  route, and neither can assert anything about inbound without a payload that
  carries a real signature. Building one by hand means re-implementing Svix's
  base string in a test, and a test that does that is asserting a reimplementation
  against a verifier — which is how two wrong things agree with each other.

  So this signs with `Courier.Inbound.Signature`'s own scheme, the same
  `Courier.Webhooks.Signature` courier uses to sign OUTBOUND webhooks, and the
  real proof that the scheme is right is the published vector in
  `test/courier/inbound/signature_test.exs`, not this fake. This fake makes the
  tests convenient; the vector makes them true.

  ## Payloads are built from the documented shape

  `bounce/1`, `complaint/1` and `delivery_delayed/1` construct the JSON Resend
  documents at <https://resend.com/docs/webhooks/emails/bounced> and its
  siblings, and `bounce/1` refuses a `bounce_type` outside the documented
  vocabulary rather than writing a payload courier would refuse to parse. A fake
  that could build an impossible payload is a fake whose tests pass for reasons
  that do not exist in production.

  ## What it does not do

  It does not verify. There is nothing here that checks a signature, because the
  only honest check of a signature is `Courier.Inbound.Signature.verify/4` and a
  fake that wrapped it would make "the test passed" and "the signature was
  correct" the same claim.
