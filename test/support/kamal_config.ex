defmodule Courier.TestSupport.KamalConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Reads courier's two Kamal configuration files, and says what they say.

  It exists because of the shape of the thing it reads. `config/kamal-backup.yml`
  names four secrets; `config/deploy.yml` lists which secrets the container that
  reads that file is given; and **the pair is only correct together** —
  `kamal-backup validate` builds the accessory's environment from the deploy
  config and from nothing else, so a secret named in one and missing from the
  other is a valid YAML file in both that fails validation with
  `RESTIC_REPOSITORY or RESTIC_REPOSITORY_FILE is required`. A reader that looked
  at one file could not see that, which is why the file that matters most to this
  module is the one it reads from both sides.

  It lives in courier's own `test/support` rather than in a shared helper, so the
  next service that adopts a backup configuration copies one file and reads it —
  the same decision `Courier.TestSupport.OpenAPIPaths` records for itself.

  ## Why this is not a YAML parser

  courier has no YAML dependency and adding one is a decision this repository has
  not made (`AGENTS.md`: "No dependency without approval"). So this reads the
  handful of keys the two contracts are made of, by indentation, and understands
  exactly that. The subset:

    * `#` comments and blank lines are dropped; a `<% … %>` ERB block is dropped
      whole. Both are dropped rather than parsed, because neither can change the
      meaning of a key this module reads.
    * a top-level key is a line at column 0 ending in `:`; a nested key is the
      same at a deeper column. Indentation is **derived from the file**, so a file
      indented with four spaces reads correctly rather than reading as empty.
    * a sequence entry is a `- ` at the indent of the key that owns it.
    * `secret: NAME` is a name and nothing else. This module refuses to
      recognise any other shape of value under a secret key, because the whole
      subject of the check is "is this a NAME", and a reader that accepted a
      literal would agree with a file that had a credential in it.

  Anything outside that subset raises. A reader that found nothing and a config
  that said nothing agree with each other, and a green check over nothing is
  worse than no check.

  ## Every reader refuses rather than under-reads

  A missing file, an empty file, a key that is absent, an accessory with no
  `env.secret`, a `databases:` list with no entries — each raises a message
  naming what it found instead of returning an empty set. That is the rule
  `Courier.TestSupport.OpenAPIPaths` states for itself and it applies here for
  the same reason: an empty set agrees with every other empty set.

  What `config/kamal-backup.yml` says.

    * `:app` — the Kamal service name, and therefore the snapshot path and the

    * `:databases` — one entry per database, each with its `name`, its `adapter`
      and the secret NAMES its `url` and `password` resolve from.
    * `:secrets` — every secret name the file names, anywhere.
    * `:schedule` — the `backup.schedule` value, as written.
    * `:paths?` — whether a `paths:` key is present, which is what decides
      whether any file snapshot is ever taken.
    * `:erb?` — whether the file still carries an ERB tag, which for this file
      would mean it was copied rather than rendered.
