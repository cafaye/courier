defmodule Courier.TestSupport.RecordingSender do
  @moduledoc """
  A `Courier.Webhooks.Sender` that records the request instead of making it.

  The assertions in `Courier.Webhooks.SenderTest` and
  `Courier.Workers.DeliverWebhookWorkerTest` are about what courier *puts on the
  wire* and *does with the answer* — the header names, the exact body bytes, the
  status classification, the retry budget — and none of that needs a socket. A
  local HTTP server would add a port, a supervisor and a timing dependency to
  assertions that are otherwise pure data, and a webhook test that fails because a
  listener had not come up yet is a test that has stopped being about webhooks.

  Two ways to drive it, because there are two kinds of caller:

    * **In the request** — `response_status`, `response_headers` and `error` are
      keys the caller puts in the request map, so one double answers every case
      without a per-case module. `Courier.Webhooks.SenderTest` uses this.
    * **Through the process dictionary** — `answer_with/1` sets the response the
      *next* sends will get, and `reset/0` clears it. The delivery worker builds
      its own request and has nowhere to put a test's status code, so the test
      tells the double instead. `Courier.Workers.DeliverWebhookWorkerTest` uses
      this.

  `reset/0` clears both the recording and the queued answer, which is what lets
  one test send several requests without reading the first one's.
