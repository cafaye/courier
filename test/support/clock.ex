defmodule Courier.TestSupport.Clock do
  @moduledoc """
  A monotonic millisecond clock a test can move, and the only reason
  `Courier.ErrorRelay`'s throttle is testable without waiting.

  ## Why the relay takes a clock as a function

  A token bucket's behaviour lives in the *shape* of its refill schedule — one
  token per `60_000 / per_minute` milliseconds, capped at `burst` — and a wall
  clock can only demonstrate that by living through it. Asserting "sixty seconds
  later there is one more token" by sleeping sixty seconds is a test that takes
  a minute, and it is the reason a schedule like this gets asserted only by
  "time passed, something happened", which is not the claim.

  So `Courier.ErrorRelay` takes `now: (() -> integer)`. In the application tree
  it is `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)`, read once per event; here it is
  this process.

  ## Named, therefore `async: false` where it is used

  A named `Agent`, so two tests moving the clock at once would make every refill
  assertion depend on the interleaving. `Courier.ErrorRelayTest` is
  `async: false` and says why in its own moduledoc. Each test starts its own via
  `start_supervised!/1`, so the name is released when the test ends and no test
  sees another's clock.
