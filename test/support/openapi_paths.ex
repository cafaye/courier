defmodule Courier.TestSupport.OpenAPIPaths do
  @moduledoc """
  Reads courier's OpenAPI document and `CourierWeb.Router`, and says where they
  disagree. The check built on this is `CourierWeb.OpenAPIDocumentTest`; this
  module is the part of it that has to be right for the check to mean anything.

  It lives in courier's own `test/support` rather than in a shared helper, so the
  next service that publishes a document copies one file and reads it.

  ## It reads responses too, not only paths

  `document_operations!/1` answers *which routes does this document describe*.
  That is not the same question as *which responses does it declare*, and a
  document can pass the first and fail the second: courier-12 found
  `openapi.yaml` describing eight operations, wiring the RFC 9457 envelope into
  every response it declared, and declaring no 500 on any of them — a status
  every one of them could return, and one a generated client needs to know is
  not a retry.

  So this module also reads each operation's `responses:` block
  (`document_responses!/1`) and the reusable responses under
  `components.responses` (`component_responses!/1`), and follows a `$ref` from
  one to the other. The check built on those is
  `CourierWeb.OpenAPIErrorResponsesTest`, which is the language-specific half a
  neutral harness cannot be: it provokes each status against the running
  endpoint and asks the document whether it admits it.

  ## Both sets are read, neither is written down

  The document's operations come from `openapi.yaml` and the router's come from
  `CourierWeb.Router.__routes__/0`. Neither side is a list this repository
  maintains, because a list is a check that can only fail for a name somebody
  remembered to type — the failure mode that made pantry-03's coverage test
  useless, and the one this check must not share.

  ## Every reader refuses rather than under-reading

  A document reader that finds nothing returns an empty set, and an empty set
  agrees with an empty set. So every way this reader could come back with less
  than it should — no `paths:` key, an empty block, a path item with no
  operations, a path key that is not a path, an indentation it did not expect, a
  missing file, a router with no routes — is a raised error whose message names
  what it found. A loud failure in the reader is worth more than a green check
  over nothing.

  ## Why this is not a YAML parser

  courier has no YAML dependency, and adding one is a decision this repository
  has not made (`AGENTS.md`: "No dependency without approval"). So this reads
  the part of the document that describes routes — the `paths:` block and the
  keys under it — by indentation, and understands exactly that.

  The subset is small and stated:

    * `paths:` at column 0, path items one level in, operations one level below
      that, and anything deeper is an operation's body and is not read. The two
      indentation levels are **derived from the document**, not assumed to be two
      and four, so four-space YAML is read correctly rather than read as empty.
    * A direct child of `paths:` is a path if it starts with `/`; otherwise it
      has to be one of the fields OpenAPI 3.1 allows directly under a path —
      `summary`, `description`, `servers`, `parameters`, `$ref`, `x-…` — and
      anything else is an error rather than a guess.
    * A key under a path is an operation if it is one of the eight HTTP method
      names and nothing else. `getaway:` is not a `GET`.
    * A key under an operation's `responses:` is a status if it is three quoted
      digits, which is how OpenAPI 3.1 writes them (`'404':`). A `default:` key is
      a response too and is read as `default`, so a document that hides an error
      behind one cannot slip past unnoticed.
    * `application/problem+json` is recognised as a **key** under a response's
      `content:`, wherever its value sits. How a media type maps to a schema is
      YAML parsing, and this reader does not parse YAML — but the question the
      check asks is "does this response name the problem media type at all", and
      that is a key at a known level.

  Anything outside that subset raises. A service that needs a real parser should
  add one and delete this; the check itself does not change.

  Two things are deliberately **not** rewritten. A `*glob` segment is left
  alone, because it matches an arbitrary tail of a path, which is a different
  shape from a `{param}`'s single segment, and treating the two as one is the
  kind of rewrite that hides a real difference — courier declares no glob, and a
  service that does will see this check report it, which is the honest answer,
  since OpenAPI has no way to write "any tail of segments" in a path template. A
  path that is missing its leading slash is not given one either: the document
  is invalid, and quietly repairing an invalid document hides the invalidity.

  is whether the **document and the router name the same operations**. That
  cannot be checked by reading either side alone: a document that documents the

  listening for, and a router that guards a route the document does not mention
  is a behaviour a generated client has never been told about. Both are the

  ## What "accepts" means here, and what it does not

  An operation counts if its own subtree names the header — either as a `$ref` to
  `#/components/parameters/IdempotencyKey` or as an inline `name: Idempotency-Key`
  parameter line. That is a **text** match over the operation's block rather than
  a parse, and the honest limit is worth stating: an unrelated line somewhere in
  the operation could be mistaken for the parameter.

  It cannot produce a false *negative*, which is the direction that matters here
  — a parameter declared in either of the two forms is found, and a missing
  declaration is a missing declaration. A false positive would be a document that
  mentions the header without declaring it, and core's own
  `openapi.idempotency-key` rule checks the declaration properly against a real
  parse, so the two checks together have no gap between them. Neither is
  sufficient alone; the point of writing them down is that neither is silently
