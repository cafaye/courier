defmodule Courier.TestSupport.IntrospectionTransport do
  @moduledoc """
  A `Courier.Principal.Introspection.Transport` that answers from a table.

  Configured as courier's introspection transport in `config/test.exs`, so the
  resolver's tests are assertions about courier's decision and not about a
  socket: what courier sends, what it does with each answer, and what it refuses.

  ## The tables are process-local and need no reset, because ExUnit runs each
  test in a fresh process. A test that stubs nothing therefore reads "no request
  was made" rather than inheriting an earlier test's answer — which is the way a
  table of recorded requests quietly becomes a table of the previous test's
  requests. A shared ETS table would need an `on_exit` and would reintroduce the
  problem it was meant to solve.

  ## The requests are recorded, because "courier sent the credential" is a claim

  `requests/0` returns every request the resolver has made **in this process**.
  Process-local rather than an ETS table on purpose: the resolver is called on the
  process that serves the request, the resolver's tests are `async: true`, and a
  shared table would make one test's request the next test's evidence.
