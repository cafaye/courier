defmodule Courier.WebhookDeliveriesTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The delivery record and the retry budget around it.

  PLAN.md §7 requires bounded budgets: "briefs forbid naive retries; consumers
  use bounded budgets". Everything here is about where the bound is, what the
  wait between attempts is, and what happens when the bound is reached — because
  an unbounded retry loop against a consumer that is gone is a way to keep
  hammering someone who has already asked courier to stop.

  The schedule is asserted as *recorded values*, never by sleeping. Nothing here
  waits for a backoff window to elapse: `backoff/1` is a function of the attempt
  number, and the test reads the number the delivery would have been given.
