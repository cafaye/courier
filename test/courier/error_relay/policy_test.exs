  @moduledoc """
  The redaction boundary, applied to a Sentry event.

  This is the file that says what may reach the error store, and it is the
  reason this repository may point an Sentry SDK at anything at all. The
  reasoning it implements is not new and it is not ours: core's
  `schemas/telemetry/redaction.schema.json` says the boundary is enforced at
  **one** chokepoint, default-deny, and the collector is that chokepoint for
  traces, metrics and logs. A Sentry envelope is a fourth signal and the
  collector cannot reach it — GlitchTip speaks the Sentry protocol, not OTLP —
  so this module is the same chokepoint, written in the language the error path
  is written in, and it is the **only** implementation of it in the fleet.

  ## The two properties this asserts, separately

  Every leak test here comes in a pair, and the pair is the point. The house
  pattern is muse's canary: a unique string placed where the caller put it,
  asserted **absent from the rendered payload**, asserted **separately** from the
  assertion that the dangerous *key* is gone. A test that only checked the key
  names would still pass if redaction were replaced by something that emptied
  every map, and a test that only checked the canary would pass if the key names
  were kept with the values scrubbed. Neither is the claim. Both are.

  ## The consequence nobody should have to discover in an incident

  An error store is a **retained, indexed, widely-readable** store, and it is
  read by a human on purpose. That is exactly the threat model core's redaction
  policy was written for, which is why the collector already deletes
  `exception.message` and `exception.stacktrace` off span events — see
  `transform/cafaye_span_events` in kit's collector config, whose comment calls
  `exception.message` "a path straight to a prompt". So **this policy removes
  the exception message and the frame variables.** What survives is the class,
  the file, the line, the function, the release, the environment, and the
  `error.type` class — which is enough to act on a crash and is nothing a
  customer typed. That is a deliberate product decision, it is the reason a
  Sentry SDK may be allowed into this fleet at all, and it is asserted below
  rather than left to a reader to infer.
