defmodule Courier.UnsubscribeHeadersTest do
  @moduledoc """
  **THE HEADERS, ON REAL MESSAGE BYTES.** Two claims, and they are proved at the
  two levels where each can fail.

  ## The negative, on the messages courier composes today

  All three of courier's notification types are transactional, so **no message
  courier can currently send carries `List-Unsubscribe` or
  `List-Unsubscribe-Post`.** That is asserted over a real composed message per
  type, through the function `Courier.Deliver` actually calls, with a paired
  assertion that no token row was minted — a "no header" assertion on its own is
  satisfied by a code path that does nothing at all, which is the same vacuity
  `Courier.TelemetryCanaryTest` was written against.

  This is the half that matters most and it is not a formality. An
  account-management email with an unsubscribe link is its own defect: a person
  who resets their password and finds an unsubscribe link has learned that the
  link does something they did not expect.

  ## The positive, on the wire

  The other half — a message that DOES carry the two headers — is asserted
  against **the bytes a real SMTP server received**: a real `gen_smtp` listener
  on a real loopback port, the real `Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP`, the real
  `gen_smtp_client` conversation, and `handle_DATA/4`'s raw `DATA` read back out
  of ETS. `Swoosh.Email.header/3` writes into a map on the struct, and a struct is
  not a message — nothing about it proves the header survives Swoosh's
  serialisation onto the wire, which is exactly where a header courier believes it
  sent can disappear. The same round trip is asserted in the negative direction,
  so "the header was on the wire" and "no header is" are both measured rather
  than one of them assumed.

  `Courier.TestSupport.SmtpServer.received?/2` matches the raw bytes rather than a
  parsed structure, for the reason its own docs give: a parser that dropped a
  header would let a leak pass.

  ## And the honest limit, stated here rather than discovered later

  **courier sends no bulk mail, so `Courier.Deliver` never takes the `:bulk` arm
  of `Courier.Unsubscribes.decorate_for/3`.** It cannot: a bulk type would have to
  be a fourth entry in `Courier.Mailers.kinds/0`, and adding a notification type
  is a change in **core** — every payload courier publishes carries
  `notification_type`, and `core/schemas/events/courier/email/*.schema.json`
  freezes that field to an enum of the three names courier sends. This repository
  does not own those schemas, and a fourth type would put a value on the bus that
  four payload schemas reject.

  So the positive case is proved where it can be proved honestly: on a real
  composed message through the real `decorate/2`, and on the wire through the real
  adapter. What is **not** proved is the branch inside `Courier.Deliver` that
  reads `Mailers.bulk?/1` and calls `decorate/2` — a bulk type does not exist to
  drive it. That is one line, and the day the core-side enum grows a fourth name
  the assertion that matters is the one this file already makes: `Mailers.kinds/0`
  covers `types/0`, so a type cannot be sent without a kind, and a kind cannot be
  `:bulk` without a row saying so.
