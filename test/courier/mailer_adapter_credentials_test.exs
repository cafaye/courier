defmodule Courier.MailerAdapterCredentialsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A password never reaches a log.

  This is the test the brief calls worth more than an assertion that something
  was logged, and it is worth more for a specific reason. An SMTP password is
  often an API key — SES, Postmark and Mailgun all issue one and call it a
  username or a password depending on the provider — so a log line carrying it
  is a credential in a store that is replicated, retained, and readable by
  everyone with log access. The failure is also silent in the way that matters:
  nothing breaks, the mail still goes out, and the leak is discovered by somebody
  reading a log.

  So every test here captures real log output and asserts the secret is ABSENT.
  Two of them also assert something else IS present, because a redaction
  boundary that deletes everything passes "no canary" and is useless — the same
  reasoning, and the same three bugs, as `Courier.TelemetryCanaryTest`.

  ## The paths that could leak, and are covered

    * `Courier.MailerAdapter.describe/1` — the startup line.
    * a real failed send through `Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP`, with the credential in
      the adapter configuration, captured across the whole call.
    * the boot refusals, which quote the environment back at the operator.
    * the "no credentials at all" refusals, which must not print what was
      missing by accident.
