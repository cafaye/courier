  @moduledoc """
  **THE PROOF.** Nothing a caller sends reaches an exportable span attribute.

  Everything else in this repository's observability work is necessary and not
  sufficient. `Courier.ObservabilityTest` asserts on the ALLOWLIST — that the names
  are names somebody already thought of, and that no name contains a word that
  names content. That proves the keys that exist are absent. It cannot prove the
  keys nobody thought of are absent, and the realistic way this leaks is not an
  attacker. It is a well-meaning engineer in six months adding
  `record(span, %{"courier.payload" => params})` because it would help debug a
  delivery, in the service whose payloads are other customers' data.

  So this file plants a canary in every field a caller controls and asserts it
  appears in NOTHING that left courier — and drives REAL requests through the REAL
  router, because the allowlist being correct says nothing about what the request
  path actually records.

  ## Why every absence assertion here is paired with a presence one

  A redaction boundary that deletes everything passes a "no canary" test and is
  useless. Three separate ways that happened in this repository while it was being
  written, each of which left the suite green:

    * an exporter implementing `export/3` where the callback is `export/4`, so it
      was never called;
    * an exporter whose `init/1` returned `:ok` where `{:ok, state}` was required,
      so the SDK dropped the span processor;
    * a `record/2` guarded on `is_map(span)` when a span is a RECORD — a tuple —
      so nothing was recorded at all.

  `Courier.TestSpans.rendered!/0` raises rather than returning an empty string, so
  a suite in which courier exported nothing fails loudly instead of passing
  quietly. That guard is the single place this is checked.

  ## The canary is SHORT, and that is deliberate

  A long canary would let a length ceiling be what makes a test pass, and a
  truncated leak is still a leak. This string is short enough that no bound in this
  repository can touch it, so what passes here passed because of the ALLOWLIST and
  nothing else.
