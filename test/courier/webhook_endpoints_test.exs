  `webhook_endpoints`: the rows courier signs for. What this file pins down is
  the set of promises the table makes to the rest of the system, because every
  one of them is something a later packet would otherwise have to reverse-engineer
  from a migration.

    * `account_id` is the tenancy key, unique with `url`, and it is never cast
      from a request body
    * the signing secret is generated here, returned once, and stored sealed
    * `status` is two values and nothing else
    * a disabled endpoint is still a row — disabling is not deleting, because
      deleting loses the history a support conversation needs
