defmodule Courier.WebhookEndpointsConfigTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The one behaviour of `Courier.WebhookEndpoints` that changes configuration: the
  resolver the SSRF guard checks addresses with.

  The whole point of the guard is that the *answer* is what gets checked, and the
  configured test resolver answers a public address. So the case that matters most
  — a name that resolves to a private address, refused by the context before it
  becomes a row — cannot be written in `Courier.WebhookEndpointsTest`, where every
  hostname resolves somewhere public. It lives here with a resolver that answers
  `10.0.0.5`, and `on_exit` puts the real one back.

  `async: false` because application env is VM-global: while this module holds a
  private-address resolver, an async endpoint test would register a URL against it
  and pass or fail on an answer neither of them asked for.
