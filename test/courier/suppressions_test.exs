defmodule Courier.SuppressionsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What a provider told courier about an address, and what courier does about it.

  This is the middle and the end of the loop the whole packet exists for:
  `CourierWeb.EmailEventsController` ingests, this records and answers, and
  `Courier.Deliver` asks before it sends. A test file that covered only the
  controller would prove a store nobody reads; one that covered only `Deliver`
  would prove a check nothing can put state into.

  ## The two states, and why there are two

  A **hard bounce** is a statement about the mailbox: RFC 5321 §5.1.1 permanent
  failure — "no such user", a null reverse path, a mailbox that cannot exist. It
  means retrying cannot help, so courier stops. `:undeliverable` is the name.

  A **complaint** is a statement about the *message*, from the person who
  received it: RFC 2142 §5, an abuse report, Postmark's `SpamNotification`, a
  Gmail "report spam". It says nothing about whether the mailbox works — the
  address may be perfectly deliverable and the message perfectly unwanted. So it
  is its own state, `:suppressed`, rather than a flavour of "address is dead".

  **Both stop the send**, and that is the decision rather than the default.
  Continuing to mail a dead address burns the sending domain's reputation, which
  is the ordinary way a domain gets suspended; continuing to mail somebody who
  marked you as spam is worse than that and is how a provider's abuse desk gets
  involved. The asymmetry is the argument: being wrong in the direction of
  sending costs a domain, and being wrong in the direction of not sending costs
  one message.

  They are kept apart anyway because an operator reading them needs to. A rise in
  `:undeliverable` is a list-hygiene problem. A rise in `:suppressed` is a
  content and reputation problem that a per-address suppression does not fix, and
  the two demand different responses.

  ## Why the state is DERIVED and never overwritten

  Rows are immutable. Nothing in courier ever updates a suppression, so there is
  no mutation rule that can be got wrong, and the address's state is a fold over
  the rows that exist:

      no rows                  -> `nil`, the address is not suppressed
      rows, all nil state      -> `nil`
      any `:suppressed`        -> `:suppressed`
      otherwise any            -> `:undeliverable`

  `:suppressed` outranks `:undeliverable` because a complaint is an instruction
  from the recipient and a bounce is a fact about the mailbox, and an instruction
  is not withdrawn by a later fact. So a hard bounce arriving after a complaint
  cannot put the address back into the sending set, and there is no code path
  that *could*, because there is no update.

  ## Why a soft bounce records nothing at all

  A soft bounce is RFC 5321 §4.2.2 temporary failure — mailbox full, greylisted,
  "try again in four hours". Suppressing on one is the classic way a suppression
  list starts eating live addresses: one provider's bad afternoon becomes a
  thousand addresses courier will never write to again, and nothing in courier's
  data can tell an operator which of them were ever real. So `ingest/2` accepts a
  soft bounce, records **no row**, and says so in the answer. The caller still
  gets its 2xx, so the provider stops retrying something courier has decided not
  to act on — being deliberately unhelpful to a provider is worse than being
  briefly silent.

  ## Idempotency is the unique index, and it is at the database

  `(provider, provider_event_id)` is unique, and a delivery that loses it is
  answered `{:ok, :duplicate, row}` with nothing written. Real providers retry —
  Postmark retries on a timeout and on any 5xx — so "the same event twice" is
  the normal case rather than the edge one. A hand-rolled "have I seen this?"
  check would be a race; the index cannot be.
