defmodule Courier.Webhooks.SenderTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What courier puts on the wire, asserted the way a consumer sees it.

  The `Courier.Webhooks.Signature` tests prove the signature is the spec's. This
  file proves the *request* is well-formed: a consumer running an official
  Standard Webhooks library — Svix's, Twilio's, the reference
  `standardwebhooks` package — reads these three headers, takes the raw body, and
  gets a verdict. If the headers were misnamed, the body were re-encoded, or the
  `Host` were wrong, this is where it shows.

  The classification half — what counts as a success, what is worth retrying,
  what a `410` means — is the spec's §Delivery success and failure table, and it
  is courier's policy rather than the sender's, so it is asserted against
  `Courier.Webhooks.Sender` directly.

  Nothing here touches a socket. The sender is a behaviour with a recording
  implementation in `test/support`, which is what lets the assertions be about
  courier's behaviour and not about a local HTTP server's timing.
