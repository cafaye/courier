defmodule Courier.Webhooks.PayloadTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The body courier puts on the wire.

  Standard Webhooks §Payload does not dictate a payload shape, but it does
  recommend one: `type`, `timestamp` of the event, and `data`, "and it should be
  grouped hierarchically". courier's body is the CloudEvents envelope itself,
  because:

    * the envelope is already `type` / `time` / `data`, and duplicating it under
      different names would mean two shapes to keep in step;
    * a consumer that already subscribes to courier's events on NATS gets the same
      document over HTTP, so there is one contract rather than two;
    * it stays inside core's `event-envelope.schema.json` unchanged, which is
      what `Courier.EventsTest` already pins.

  The one thing the spec is emphatic about is that the bytes sent are the bytes
  signed. These tests pin that by encoding once and asserting the same binary is
  what gets signed and what is described.
