defmodule Courier.BackupTablesTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What a `pg_dump` of courier's one database actually carries — read from the
  live schema, not from a list somebody wrote down.

  ## Why this is a database test and not a config test

  `config/kamal-backup.yml` declares no `paths:`, and the reason it may not need
  any is a claim about **courier's tables**: there is no `bytea` column, no
  object-store key and no attachment table, because courier has no object
  storage and uploads nothing. A test that asserted that from the YAML would be
  asserting the comment next to it.

  So this asks Postgres. It reads `information_schema.columns` for the connected
  database and asserts two things: that every table a dump would carry is a table
  courier's own migrations created (so nothing rides along unreviewed), and that
  no column anywhere holds bytes or a pointer to bytes held somewhere else
  (so the absence of a `paths:` list is true of the data rather than only of the
  config).

  That second assertion is the load-bearing one, and it is deliberately paired
  with a presence assertion. A "no bytea anywhere" test passes on a database with
  nothing in it, which is the same vacuity `Courier.TelemetryCanaryTest` was
  written against. So it also asserts the tables it *did* find, by name, and the
  row counts are not asserted at all: the claim is about the SHAPE, and a shape
  assertion that counted rows would break every time a test inserted one.

  ## The list is derived from the live schema, not from the migrations

  Reading `information_schema` rather than parsing `priv/repo/migrations` is the
  choice that matters. Migrations are history; the schema is what a dump
  contains. A migration that was later rolled back, or one that creates an index
  rather than a table, changes the first and not the second — and an operator
  restoring cares about the second.

  `oban_jobs` and `oban_peers` are in the list because Oban's DDL is applied by a
  migration that calls `Oban.Migrations.up/1` rather than by a literal
  `create table`, so a migration-reading test would miss them entirely and a
  schema-reading one does not.
