defmodule Courier.InboundConfigTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The inbound signing secret: how it is stored, and the shape assertions that
  stand in for a boot this suite does not perform.

  ## Why the shape is asserted and not just read

  Both of these were wrong at least once while this surface was being built, and
  neither is visible in a config file:

    * `config :courier, :inbound_secrets, resend: "…"` — the keyword shorthand —
      stores a **keyword list**. `Application.get_env/2` hands that back looking
      nothing like the map the lookup reads, and the symptom is a `BadMapError` on
      the request path of a route whose entire vocabulary is a 400, a 401, a 422
      and a 500 and never a crash.
    * an **atom** key does not match a **string** lookup, because the lookup key
      comes from the request's path. That one is a 500 on every delivery, naming
      a missing variable, while the variable is set and correct.

  Both are the same class of error as the `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY` one this
  repository already refuses: a required value with a shape nothing checks, where
  a deployment that got it wrong boots cleanly and then fails every request.
  `config/runtime.exs` refuses to boot without the variable, and this file holds
  it to the two shapes that would pass that refusal and still not work.

  ## The production refusal itself is not tested here

  `config/runtime.exs` is not evaluated in the test environment — it is guarded by
  `config_env() == :prod` and running it would need a `DATABASE_URL` and a
  `SECRET_KEY_BASE` as well. The **release** job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  asserts the refusal for real, alongside the one for `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`,
  because that is the only place a production `runtime.exs` is ever evaluated.
