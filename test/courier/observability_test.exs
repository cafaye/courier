defmodule Courier.ObservabilityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The allowlist, asserted on directly.

  `Courier.TelemetryCanaryTest` proves no caller-supplied content reaches an
  exportable span. This file proves the ALLOWLIST is the thing doing the work,
  and the two are not the same claim: a canary test can be satisfied by a service
  that exports nothing, and an allowlist test can be satisfied by a service that
  never calls `record/2`. Both are needed, and each says which failure it catches.

  The pattern throughout is muse's, promoted: the realistic way courier's
  redaction boundary fails is not an attacker. It is a well-meaning engineer in
  six months adding `span.set_attribute("payload", params)` because it would help
  debug a delivery, in the one service in the fleet whose payloads are other
  customers' data. So the list itself is the assertion, and the words it may not
  contain are written down.

  # `spans_for/1` clears it, drives one span, flushes, and reads it back. Two async
  # tests doing that interleave and each reads the other's span — which produces
  # failures that look like redaction failures and are not one.
