defmodule Courier.MailerAdapterTest do
  @moduledoc """
  courier will not boot into a configuration that cannot send mail.

  The property under test is the one the previous configuration violated: a
  released courier accepted every send, reported a provider-shaped message id,
  and mailed nobody. So these are not tests about a configuration function being
  tidy. Each one is a shape a real deployment takes, and the claim is that courier
  refuses it at boot rather than starting and looking healthy.

  The refusals are asserted as RAISES because that is what refuses a boot. A
  function returning `{:error, :no_adapter}` would leave the caller to decide
  whether to continue, and the caller is `config/runtime.exs`, which either
  configures the adapter or does not start.
