  `Courier.Deliver` is where courier's three promises meet: the user's
  preference wins, the provider's answer is recorded, and the event describing
  the send is written in the same transaction as the send — so a message that
  went out is a message the platform can see, and a message the platform cannot
  see did not go out.

  Nothing here touches NATS. The relay that publishes to NATS is
  `Courier.Workers.ProcessOutboxWorker`, and this file asserts only that the row
  is there, in the shape the relay will publish.
