defmodule Courier.Workers.ProcessOutboxWorkerConfigTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The relay's two configurable behaviours: how many rows it claims per run, and
  what it does when the publisher refuses.

  A refusal is reported as `{:error, summary}`, where the summary carries
  `published`, `failed`, and the first `reason` the publisher gave — Oban retries
  the job because of the error tuple, and the reason is what makes the retry
  readable in the job's own error rather than a bare atom with no count
  attached.

  `async: false` because both cases change application env, which the whole VM
  shares: while this module holds a one-row batch or a failing publisher, an
  async relay test would run against them instead of the real configuration.
  `on_exit` restores both before the next test starts.
