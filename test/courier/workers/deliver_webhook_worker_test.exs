defmodule Courier.Workers.DeliverWebhookWorkerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The sender: claims a due delivery, signs it, sends it, and records what came
  back — including the two things that keep courier from hammering a customer who
  is not listening: the retry budget and the circuit breaker.

  Nothing here sleeps. `perform_job/3` runs the worker in-process, and the
  backoff is asserted on the *recorded* `next_attempt_at` rather than by waiting
  for a window to pass, so a five-minute backoff costs the suite five minutes of
  nothing.
