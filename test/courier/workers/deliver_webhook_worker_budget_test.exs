defmodule Courier.Workers.DeliverWebhookWorkerBudgetTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The retry budget on its own, with the circuit breaker held out of the way.

  The two bounds are separate — PLAN.md §7 requires bounded budgets, and courier
  has two of them — but at the shipped numbers the circuit opens after 5 failures
  and the budget is 8, so the budget can only be observed with the circuit raised
  out of reach. `on_exit` puts the real configuration back.

  `async: false` because application env is VM-global: while this module holds a
  raised threshold, an async worker test would be asserting against a circuit that
  is not the one courier ships.
