defmodule Courier.Workers.ProcessOutboxWorkerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The relay is courier's only consumer of its own database: it claims unpublished
  rows in a batch, hands each to the publisher, and marks what it published.
  Delivery here is at-least-once, so what matters is that a row is never marked
  without being published and never published without being claimed — not that
  it is published exactly once.

  Nothing sleeps. Jobs are performed in-process with `perform_job/3`
  (Oban.Testing), so the row is marked before the assertion reads it.

  The two cases that change configuration — a one-row batch, and a publisher
  that fails — live in `Courier.Workers.ProcessOutboxWorkerConfigTest`, because
  application env is VM-global and this file is `async: true`.
