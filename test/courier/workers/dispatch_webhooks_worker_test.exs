defmodule Courier.Workers.DispatchWebhooksWorkerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The fan-out: an event in the outbox becomes one delivery per enabled endpoint of
  the account it belongs to.

  Delivery is at-least-once, so this worker is idempotent by construction — it
  runs on a timer, runs again after a crash, and may run twice concurrently on two
  replicas. The assertions that matter are therefore not "it sent N things" but
  "it does not send N things twice", which is what the `webhook_deliveries`
  unique index is for.
