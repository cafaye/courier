defmodule Courier.EventsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The envelope is core's contract, not courier's: `cafaye/core`'s
  `schemas/event-envelope.schema.json` is where these rules live, and core's
  suite is what ultimately validates courier's output against it.

  This file restates the schema's constraints as assertions, so that drift shows
  up in courier's own suite instead of in core's. The patterns are transcribed
  from that schema — they are the contract, not courier's opinion of it. A new
  event type is not something courier gets to invent quietly: registering one is
  a checklist in core's docs/event-naming.md, and the catalog test below is the
  reminder that the list of types courier may emit is shorter than the list of
  types one could imagine.

  ## The payload schemas, which are four files and one more per type

  Each event's `data` has a schema in **core**, at
  `schemas/events/<service>/<entity>/<action>.schema.json` — the event type with
  the dots turned into directory separators. They live in core rather than here
  because a payload schema is a promise to *other* services, and a publisher that
  owns its own contract is describing something its consumers never read. So the
  four courier payload schemas are transcribed at the top of this file as
  `@bounce_payload_fields`, `@suppression_payload_fields`, `@notification_type`,
  `@message_id` and `@reasons`, each with the path it came from, and the
  builders are asserted against those transcriptions rather than against
  courier's own idea of a payload.

  Three of the four carry the same four fields — `courier.email.queued`,
  `.delivered`, `.bounced` and `.complained` are identical in shape — and
  `courier.notification.suppressed` is the one that is not, because it has no
  `message_id` (nothing was rendered, so there is no notification to be about)
  and its subject is the recipient rather than the notification. That difference
  is core's D8, in core's `DECISIONS.md`, and a builder that got it wrong would
  be a publisher of an event no consumer could join.

  ## A builder is a shape, not an emission

  Four of the catalogued types have builders here and `courier.email.queued` does
  not. That is the honest split and it is asserted below rather than left to a
  reader of the moduledoc: a builder exists because courier can produce the four
  facts, and something that *publishes* it is a separate decision this module
  does not make.
