defmodule Courier.UnsubscribesTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The one-click unsubscribe as a library: mint a token, find it, act on it.

  This is the half of the RFC 8058 implementation that is not HTTP. The route
  that calls it is `CourierWeb.UnsubscribeControllerTest`, and the headers it puts
  on a message are `Courier.UnsubscribeHeadersTest` — three files because the
  claims are three different ones and a file asserting all of them would be a file
  whose failures do not say which thing broke.

  ## What is asserted here, and what is asserted elsewhere

  Here: the token is stored as a digest and never as itself; a token courier did
  not issue is not a token; the row it writes carries **no state** and is
  therefore invisible to the address-level fold; the row and its event are written
  together or not at all; a second call changes nothing and announces nothing; and
  the payload on the bus is the four fields **core's** schema requires, with the
  user as the subject and no `message_id`.

  ## The state-less row is the load-bearing assertion in this file

  A bounce and a complaint carry a state and stop **every** type courier sends.
  An unsubscribe stops **one**. If the row this module wrote carried `:suppressed`,
  a person who unsubscribed from product updates would no longer receive their
  password reset — so the tests assert the negative as well as the positive: the
  row has no state, `Suppressions.state/1` is `nil` for that address,
  `Suppressions.suppressed?/1` is false, and a real `Courier.Deliver` send of a
  *different* type still goes out.

  ## The transaction, and how a rollback is provoked rather than assumed

  "The row and its event are written in one transaction" is the kind of claim a
  test proves by breaking one of them and looking at the other. So it is broken:
  the test mints a token for a notification type courier does not send, which is
  what a deployment gets by withdrawing a type after the fact — written with raw
  SQL because the changeset refuses it, and the refusal **is** the subject under
  test. `Courier.Suppressions.unsubscribe/1` then refuses it at the far end, the
  transaction unwinds, and the assertion is that **no event was published**. A
  half-recorded unsubscribe is the whole failure, and the positive case (both rows
  present) is asserted beside it so a file that recorded nothing cannot pass it.
