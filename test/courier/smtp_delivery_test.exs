defmodule Courier.SmtpDeliveryTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The SMTP adapter is really wired: a message crosses a real socket.

  Every other test in this repository asserts about courier. This one asserts
  about courier *and a provider*, because the failure it exists to prevent is
  invisible to a test that stops one layer short. `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` returns
  a provider-shaped id out of memory and `Swoosh.Adapters.Test` hands the message
  to the process that sent it — neither opens a socket — so a courier whose
  adapter could not reach anything looked exactly like a courier that worked.

  So: a real `gen_smtp` server on a real ephemeral loopback port
  (`Courier.TestSupport.SmtpServer`), the real `Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP`, the real
  `gen_smtp_client` conversation underneath it, and assertions about the bytes
  that arrived. Nothing here is mocked, and nothing here would pass with the
  Local adapter configured.

  ## Why the whole conversation is driven rather than stubbed

  Each test below configures the adapter and calls `Courier.Mailers.deliver/2` —
  the same two lines production runs. A test that built a `%Swoosh.Email{}` by
  hand and handed it to `Mailer.deliver/1` would prove the adapter works while
  saying nothing about whether courier composes a message it can actually send,
  and the two have been broken independently in this repository.

  # `async: false`, and the reason is the application environment rather than the
