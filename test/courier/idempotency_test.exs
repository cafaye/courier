defmodule Courier.IdempotencyTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The arithmetic behind `Idempotency-Key`, tested without a plug pipeline.

  The half that is easy to get quietly wrong is not the replay — it is the three
  ways a claim can be *refused*, and the expiry, because each of them is the
  difference between "a retry is free" and "a retry is a duplicate". Every
  refusal below is therefore a test of its own rather than a branch inside a
  larger test, and the one that matters most is the last: a key the caller has
  not used for a day has to behave as though it had never been used, with no
  sweeper job to make that true.
