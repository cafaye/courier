defmodule Courier.MailersTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Courier composes mail; it does not send it, store it, or model users. These
  tests pin what the platform hands in — a payload map keyed the way the
  platform's events are keyed — to what a person receives.

  `build/2` is what `Courier.Deliver` calls, and it is the seam that keeps
  Swoosh out of the assertions: a built `Swoosh.Email` can be read directly,
  field by field, with no adapter and no mailbox.
