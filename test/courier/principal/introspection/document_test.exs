defmodule Courier.Principal.Introspection.DocumentTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What courier makes of identity's answer, with no network, no database and no
  endpoint in the way.

  This is the module that decides three things the packet called judgement calls,
  and each of them is settled by a table rather than by a paragraph:

    * **whether the token is usable** — and it is *one* answer for every reason
      it is not, because identity already collapsed them and a resolver that
      re-expands them re-creates the oracle identity's own moduledoc is about;
    * **where the account comes from** — `account_id` and nothing else, with no
      `sub` fallback anywhere, asserted here behaviourally *and* on the source;
    * **what courier does with the scope claims** — both names, and a decision
      about what to do when one is missing and when the shape is unreadable.

  ## Why a separate module exists at all

  Because the alternative is a parsing function inside the module that opens a
  socket, and then "an inactive token is a 401" is a claim about a `Req` call
  that has to be dialled, stubbed and re-stubbed to test. Splitting the two means
  every rule below is a table over a literal, and the resolver's own tests are
  left with the one question they are actually about: does courier turn this
  answer into this status.
