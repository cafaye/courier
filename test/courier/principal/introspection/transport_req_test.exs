defmodule Courier.Principal.Introspection.Transport.ReqTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The side of the seam that opens a socket, driven through Req's own plug adapter.

  `test/courier/principal/introspection_test.exs` runs the resolver against
  `Courier.TestSupport.IntrospectionTransport`, so **nothing in the suite proves
  the shipped transport builds the request identity is documented to expect.** A
  seam tested from one side only is a seam nobody checked: a typo in the path, a
  missing content type, or a header under the wrong name is invisible to a suite
  that answers from a table — and the symptom in production is a 403 from identity
  that looks exactly like a misconfigured credential.

  So this file drives `Transport.Req` itself with `plug: {Req.Test, …}`, which is
  Req's documented way of running a real request against a plug instead of a
  socket. The assertions below are therefore about the request `Transport.Req`
  really built, and they are the four things identity's contract requires of it:
  the path, the method, a JSON body carrying `token`, and one authorization header.

  ## What each side of the seam is responsible for

  The resolver decides **which** headers courier sends and **what goes in the
  body**; `test/courier/principal/introspection_test.exs` asserts that, against
  the double, on the exact bytes. This file asserts that whatever the caller hands
  the transport **arrives** — path, method, headers, body — which is the half a
  double cannot see.

  **The body is asserted as `body_params` rather than as bytes.** `Req.Plug` hands
  the stub a `%Plug.Conn{}` whose body has been consumed by `Plug.Parsers`, and
  the raw bytes live in a private `Req.Plug.Adapter` field — asserting on that
  would make this file break on a Req upgrade without making the property any
  truer, and this repository's readers raise rather than under-read.
