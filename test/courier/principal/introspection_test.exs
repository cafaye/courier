defmodule Courier.Principal.IntrospectionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The resolver: courier's door, and the key it turns.

  Everything asserted here is about the seam between an inbound request and
  identity's answer, and it is asserted over the whole `resolve/1` rather than
  over a stubbed private function — a resolver whose parts are right and whose
  composition is wrong authenticates nobody, and that failure looks exactly like
  a misconfigured identity.

  ## The transport is a double, and that is a deliberate boundary

  `Courier.Principal.Introspection.Transport` is the seam and
  `Courier.TestSupport.IntrospectionTransport` answers from a table a test
  writes. So nothing here opens a socket, and the suite's no-network rule holds.
  The transport that actually opens one is `Transport.Req`, and it is exercised
  against Req's own plug adapter in
  `test/courier/principal/introspection/transport_req_test.exs` — because a seam
  that is only ever tested from one side is a seam nobody checked.
