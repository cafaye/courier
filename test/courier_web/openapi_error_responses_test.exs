defmodule CourierWeb.OpenAPIErrorResponsesTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `openapi.yaml` and courier's endpoint have to agree about **responses**, the way
  `CourierWeb.OpenAPIDocumentTest` holds them to agreeing about paths.

  ## Why this file exists

  courier-12 was opened on a measurement that every operation could return a **500**
  and none of the eight declared one, that every operation could return a **406**
  and none declared it, and that six of core's nine reserved codes appeared
  nowhere in the document. The path check that already existed could not have
  caught any of it, and could not be made to: it compares `{method, path}` sets,
  which are identical whether or not a 500 is declared. This file compares
  statuses, and it compares them in **both** directions, because the two failures
  are different and only one of them is visible.

  A status a client can receive and the document does not describe is a case the
  client handles with whatever its default branch is. A status the document
  describes and the client can never receive is a case a client wrote for nothing,
  and it is the one that reads as tidiness — courier-12 found both, on the same
  file, in the same status.

  ## How it works, and why it is not a list

  The direction *a status the endpoint can return is a status the document
  declares* is checked by **provoking** it and asking. There is no table of
  statuses per operation written down anywhere in this file, because a table is a
  check that can only fail for a case somebody remembered to type. The operations
  come from `Courier.TestSupport.OpenAPIPaths`, the path parameters are filled in
  mechanically, and the statuses come from sending requests to the real endpoint.

  That is also the half a neutral, language-agnostic harness cannot do: it needs a
  running Phoenix, a plug pipeline, and a real `problem+json` body. This is the
  language-specific half, and it is why the document's own path test and this one
  are both kept.

  The other direction — *the document declares nothing courier cannot return* —
  cannot be proved by provoking, because the way to prove a status is unreachable
  is to fail to reach it. It is therefore asserted against a short, named list of
  statuses courier was measured not to send, each with the reason, and each also
  required to appear in the document's own header. A status courier starts
  returning has to be added in the same commit that starts returning it, and this
  test is what makes that a decision rather than a drift.

  `async: true`, like the two document checks it sits beside: it reads a file and
  sends requests through the test adapter, and starts no process the suite shares.
