  @moduledoc """
  What courier does on an unhandled error, and the four promises the packet makes
  about it. Read this as the brief's "Done means", one describe per promise.

  ## The central test, and why it is the central test

  The brief's hardest requirement is a **failing-if-broken** test that no secret
  reaches a stored error, and the property that makes it hard is that the
  interesting leaks are not the ones anybody thinks of. A JWT in an `extra` key is
  the easy case. The ones that actually happen are:

    * the exception's own **message**, because a provider rejection quotes the
      caller's content back at you and an Elixir `raise "no account <id>"`
      interpolates whatever was in scope;
    * the frame **variables**, which in Elixir are the function's arguments and
      which the SDK renders as a `vars` map;
    * a `request` object, because the Sentry Elixir SDK's Phoenix integration
      populates one by default with the URL, the headers and the body — and the
      body of a courier request is somebody's email address;
    * `breadcrumbs`, which are a stream of URLs with query strings;
    * the **`user`**, which is a user id, and `user_id` is on core's prohibited
      measurement list.

  So the test below puts a distinct canary in each of those places, the way the
  caller's data would actually arrive, and then asserts — separately, and on the
  **bytes the transport received** — that none of the five appears. Two halves
  that are deliberately kept apart:

    * **the keys are gone**, so a reader can see *what* was removed; and
    * **the canaries are absent from the rendered payload**, so the claim does not
      depend on the key names.

  A test that only checked the keys would still pass if redaction were replaced by
  something that emptied every map. A test that only checked the canaries would
  still pass if the keys survived with the values scrubbed — which is a real and
  much weaker guarantee. Neither is the claim. Both are, and the house pattern
  is muse's canary, which core's `redaction.schema.json` names as `verifier`.

  ## Why the test runs the real SDK

  Because the alternative is asserting on a struct the test built by hand, which
  never touches the code that decides what goes into the event. The only thing
  replaced is the socket
  (`Courier.TestSupport.SentryTestClient`); event construction, `before_send`,
  the class tag, and envelope framing are all the SDK's own.

  ## `async: false`, and why

  Three things in this file are suite-wide: the `:sentry` application env (read
  into `:persistent_term` when the SDK application starts, and the SDK documents
  that it will not re-read it), and the test transport's delivery target, which is
  `:persistent_term`. Both are the whole VM. So this file is `async: false` and
  says why, which is what `AGENTS.md` asks of any test that changes application
  env — and it is why this is a file of its own rather than a describe inside
  another.
