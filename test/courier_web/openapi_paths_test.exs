  @moduledoc """
  The reader's own tests, and the tests for every normalisation it applies.

  This file exists because the check in `CourierWeb.OpenAPIDocumentTest` is only
  worth having if the thing producing the two sets is itself trustworthy. A
  normaliser is a place a check can be made to pass by a rename that should have
  failed it, so every rule gets a test naming the case it covers — and the
  comparison gets tests that inject faults, because a checker that cannot be
  shown to fail has not been shown to work.

  The fault tests drive the real readers rather than hand-built maps, so the
  thing under test is the code the check runs, not a tidier imitation of it.
