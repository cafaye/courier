defmodule CourierWeb.MessagesControllerConfigTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The two refusals that need configuration changed to reach.

  `async: false` because both swap `config :courier, Courier.Mailer`, and
  application env is VM-global: for the length of this module any other test in
  the suite that delivers mail would deliver it through the substituted adapter
  instead of the Test adapter. `on_exit` restores it before the next test starts.

  ## Why these two live in their own file rather than in the endpoint's

  Neither case can be reached through `messages_controller_test.exs`, and the
  reasons are the point:

    * **A provider that refuses** needs an adapter that fails.
      `Swoosh.Adapters.Test` cannot fail — it hands the message to the sending
      process and answers `{:ok, %{}}` — so the only way through the real Swoosh
      path is to substitute one. `Courier.DeliverAdapterTest` already does this
      for the context; this file does it for the HTTP answer.
    * **An adapter that cannot deliver** needs the *production* scope, because
      `Test` and `Local` are the correct adapters in the environments that
      configure them and refusing them everywhere would mean the suite could never
      send a mail. `Courier.MailerAdapter.config_env/0` reads
      `Application.get_env(:courier, :environment)`, which is what makes that
      scope reachable from a test at all, and setting it here is the whole reason
      `config_env/0` exists rather than `Mix.env/0`.

  Swapping the mailer is also why the checks here are about courier's own rows and
  never the table's: another test may well be writing outbox rows concurrently
  while this module holds the VM.
