defmodule CourierWeb.NotificationPreferencesControllerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The JSON API over notification preferences, the error envelope core requires
  around it, and the authorization on it: `application/problem+json`, a stable
  code, a `trace_id` that matches the `X-Trace-Id` header, per-field errors on a
  422, and a 404 for a user whose preferences belong to another account.

  ## The authorization matrix is the same three questions the webhooks ask

  `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal` decides who is asking and `notification_preferences`
  records the account, so the three answers here are the three answers
  `WebhookEndpointsControllerTest` gives:

    * **anonymous → 401**, on both verbs, and the *same* 401 the webhook
      endpoints answer — asserted here by comparing the two bodies, because
      "it is behind a plug" is a claim about the router and "it is refused the
      way everything else is refused" is a claim about what a client receives.
    * **another account → 404**, on both verbs, because core's conventions forbid
      a 403 that leaks existence. The 404 is on the *user*, and it is only there
      once somebody has written rows for that user: a user courier has never been
      asked about is still a 200 with the defaults, because courier does not own
      users and cannot tell an account's user from one that does not exist.
    * **owning account → 200**, which is every other test in this file.

  The identity of the caller comes from a header the *test* sets. That is a seam
  with one implementation today and identity's JWT verifier behind it, not
  authentication; `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal`'s moduledoc says so, and its
  default resolver authenticates nobody, so a deployed courier without that
  verifier refuses these requests rather than serving them to whoever asks.
