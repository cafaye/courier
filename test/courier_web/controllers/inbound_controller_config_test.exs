defmodule CourierWeb.InboundControllerConfigTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `POST /inbound/resend` when **courier** is the thing that is wrong.

  ## Why this is its own file and not `async: false` in the other one

  `Application.put_env/3` is the whole VM. A test that changes it has to be
  `async: false`, and a module cannot be both `async: true` and `async: false` —
  so the case lives here. `AGENTS.md` states the rule and names three files that
  keep to it: `ProcessOutboxWorkerConfigTest`, `WebhookEndpointsConfigTest` and
  `DeliverWebhookWorkerBudgetTest`. This is the fourth, for the same reason and no
  new one: a test that changes application env belongs in a `*ConfigTest`.

  ## What is being varied, and why only the secret

  Exactly one variable: whether courier holds a signing secret for the provider
  the route is for. Everything else — the request, the signature, the body, the
  provider — is courier's real machinery, so the assertion is about courier
  answering a question about its own configuration and not about a mock.

  ## Why the answer is 500 and not 401

  **`Courier.Inbound.Signature`'s moduledoc raises this objection by name**: "a
  route answering 500 to a misconfigured secret is indistinguishable from one
  under attack, and the operator's first question would be the wrong one." So the
  two are told apart by status, and this file is the half of that claim which
  needs a misconfigured courier to hold:

    * no secret at all → **500**, naming the variable to set;
    * a secret that is present but undecodable → **500** too, because it is the
      same defect one layer in (`Courier.Inbound.Signature.fetch_key/1` refusing
      what `runtime.exs` was happy to store);
    * a secret that does not match the request → **401**, and that is
      `inbound_controller_test.exs`'s case.

  The cost of the split is one 500 a forged request cannot reach, because a forger
  cannot make courier's own configuration wrong. The benefit is that an operator
  looking at a 500 gets the right first question, which is the whole of it.
