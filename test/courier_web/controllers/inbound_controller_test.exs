  `POST /inbound/resend` — the door `Courier.Suppressions.ingest/1` was waiting for.

  ## The negative cases are this file

  `Courier.InboundTest` proves the library half: verify, then parse, then ingest,
  and an unsigned payload records nothing. This file proves the half that only
  exists at HTTP, and it is the half that can go wrong without anybody noticing:

    * **an unauthenticated `POST` that records suppressions.** Anyone who finds
      the URL could suppress anyone's mail, which is a denial of service on the
      whole product delivered by the feature meant to protect it. So every
      refusal below is paired with `assert_nothing_written/1` over the address
      that refusal's payload named.
    * **a route that parses before it verifies.** `CourierWeb.Plugs.ParseBody` is
      an *endpoint* plug, so it runs on every request; on this route it must not,
      or a decoder sees a body nobody has authenticated. The direct evidence is
      `test/courier_web/plugs/parse_body_test.exs`, and the behavioural evidence
      is the first describe below: an unsigned request carrying a payload courier
      would happily have acted on is refused, and records nothing.
    * **an answer that echoes the address.** `POST /v1/messages` deliberately does
      not, and this route has the same reason and more of it: the table has no
      `account_id`, so anything that quotes an address back is a way to ask
      courier questions about mailboxes it holds. A refusal carries the *reason*
      and no part of the *request*, and that is asserted with a canary rather
      than by reading the strings.

  ## Every count is over this test's own address

  `email_suppressions` has no `account_id`, its rows are permanent, and
  `AGENTS.md` is explicit that a count over the whole table is a claim about
  every other test in the repository. So every assertion here filters by an
  address minted for that one call, and `assert_nothing_written/1` is the one
  place that says it.

  ## The events are asserted, not inferred

  `Courier.Events.bounced/1` and `complained/1` had no caller when this packet
  started, which is the defect the previous packet was opened for. A builder with
  no caller is indistinguishable from a builder that is wrong, so the events are
  read out of `outbox_events` here — and a bounce is published with the `user_id`
  and `notification_type` of the **send that caused it**, which the test obtains
  by really sending one and using the message id the provider would have quoted.
