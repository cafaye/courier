defmodule CourierWeb.WebhookEndpointsControllerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `/v1/webhook_endpoints` — the API, the envelope, and the authorization matrix.

  ## Why there is an authorization section at all

  `NotificationPreferencesController` says in its own moduledoc that its requests
  are unauthenticated in this packet, because courier does not verify JWTs yet.
  That is a real gap and it is a *known* one, recorded rather than hidden. Webhook
  endpoints are the first courier resource where the gap would be a breach rather
  than an inconvenience: an endpoint's url and its signing secret are a way to make
  courier send signed requests, and an unauthenticated `GET` on the list is a way
  to enumerate them.

  So this surface refuses anonymous requests outright. That is the narrow,
  defensible answer for a service that has no token verifier yet, and the matrix
  below is what holds the line while the JWT packet lands:

    * **anonymous → 401**, always, on every action. A missing principal is not a
      request courier will guess an account for.
    * **wrong account → 404**, never 403. Core's OpenAPI conventions are explicit:
      "Never 404 for authorization failures on a resource the caller cannot see —
      404 is correct there, 403 is not allowed to leak existence." A 403 would
      confirm the endpoint exists to someone who cannot see it.
    * **owning account → 200/201/204**, and the tenant is the account the endpoint
      belongs to, never one from the body.

  The identity of the caller comes from `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal`, which reads
  a header the *test* sets. A plug that reads a caller-supplied header is not
  authentication — it is a seam with exactly one implementation today and a JWT
  verifier behind it later. The moduledoc says so, and the default implementation
  authenticates nothing, so a deployed courier without the later packet does not
  have a hole where authentication was assumed.
