defmodule CourierWeb.ErrorJSONTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Every non-2xx response courier sends is core's problem+json
  (`core/docs/openapi-conventions.md`), and this is where the ones Phoenix
  renders by itself are pinned: a request that matched no route, and a request
  that blew up, must be the same envelope as the ones a controller sends
  deliberately.

  The shape this file used to assert — `%{errors: %{detail: "Not Found"}}`, the
  Phoenix default the generated application shipped with — is not a cafaye error
  body. The endpoints and the clients in this platform are written against
  `application/problem+json` with a stable `code` and a `trace_id`, so
  courier-02 replaced it. `CourierWeb.NotificationPreferencesControllerTest`
  covers the same envelope as a client sees it, over a real request.

  Rendering is `render/2` on its own here — the assigns a request would leave
  behind are the interesting part and are exercised end to end by the
  controller test, so the unit here is about the code and title.
