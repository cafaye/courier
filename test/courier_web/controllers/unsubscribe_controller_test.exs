defmodule CourierWeb.UnsubscribeControllerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `POST` and `GET /unsubscribe/:token` over real requests: the RFC 8058 one-click
  door, and everything the recipient's mail client can do to it.

  ## This is the file that proves the endpoint, and it drives the real router

  Not `Courier.Unsubscribes` — that is `Courier.UnsubscribesTest`, and a library
  test cannot show that the route is served, that the token in the path is what is
  read, that an unauthenticated `POST` is not a 401, or that no `Location` header
  comes back. Those are all facts about HTTP.

  ## The body is exercised the way RFC 8058 §8.1 spells it

  The RFC's own worked example sends
  `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with the body
  `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`, and §3.2 says the receiver "sends the key/value
  pair in the `List-Unsubscribe-Post` header as the request body". So that exact
  request is one of the tests: an endpoint that only worked for an empty body
  would work for nobody.

  ## The `POST` that acts on the path rather than on the body

  `Plug.Parsers` merges a request body into `conn.params`, so a body carrying its
  own `token` could name a different mailbox than the path did — and the whole
  authority of this route is the path segment. The test below sends exactly that
  request, with a real token in the body and a real one in the path, and asserts
  the path won.

  ## What is deliberately NOT tested here

  **No 401.** RFC 8058 §3.1 forbids this request from carrying authorization at
  all, and `openapi.yaml` declares no 401 for either operation; a token courier
  did not issue is a **404**, which is the subject's absence rather than a
  refused credential. `CourierWeb.OpenAPIErrorResponsesTest` provokes the statuses
  this route can send against the document, so the two cannot disagree.
