defmodule CourierWeb.MessagesControllerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `POST /v1/messages` is courier's only door into its send path, so this file is
  written in the order a caller experiences it: **it is refused**, **it is
  refused for the right reason**, and only then does it deliver.

  The negative cases come first on purpose. A send endpoint with a happy-path
  test is the shape of a route that accepts everything: the interesting failure
  modes of a mail egress are all *refusals* — no principal, a body courier cannot
  build, a recipient who asked not to be written to, a mailbox that hard-bounced
  months ago — and a suite that only asserts `200` has tested none of them.

  ## Every count here is over courier's own rows, never the table's

  The "nothing was written" assertions filter the outbox by the **recipient
  address this test minted**, which is unique per call. `Repo.aggregate(
  OutboxEvent, :count) == 0` would be a claim about every other test in the
  repository as much as about this one — see AGENTS.md.

  ## No real email is sent

  `config/test.exs` configures `Swoosh.Adapters.Test`, and the adapter hands each
  message to the sending process as `{:email, email}`. The real adapter is
  exercised against a real `:gen_smtp_server` in `test/courier/smtp_delivery_test.exs`,
  and the adapter courier *cannot* deliver through is covered in
  `test/courier_web/controllers/messages_controller_config_test.exs`. Nothing here
  opens a socket.
