defmodule CourierWeb.Plugs.PrincipalConfigTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The plug's two refusals, driven over real requests with the introspection
  resolver configured.

  ## Why this file changes application environment, and why it is its own file

  `config :courier, :principal` is read per request by
  `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal.resolver/0`, and the whole VM shares the application
  environment — so a test that swaps it is `async: false` and lives alone in a
  file named `*ConfigTest`, exactly as `ProcessOutboxWorkerConfigTest`,
  `WebhookEndpointsConfigTest` and `DeliverWebhookWorkerBudgetTest` do. The
  previous value is restored in `on_exit`.

  ## What is asserted here that `introspection_test.exs` cannot be

  The other file proves courier's DECISION — `:ok`, `:error`,
  `{:error, :unavailable}`. This one proves the plug's three RESPONSES: a 401 that
  is byte for byte the 401 courier has always sent, a 503 in
  `CourierWeb.Problem`'s envelope carrying the media type, the `instance` and the
  `trace_id` a client correlates on, and a request that actually reaches a
  controller once identity says the token is live.
