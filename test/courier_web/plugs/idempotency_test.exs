  `Idempotency-Key`, over real requests through the real router.

  `Courier.IdempotencyTest` covers the storage. This file covers the half that
  only a running pipeline can show, and the half that matters most is not the
  happy path — it is that a retry **does not mutate twice**. So the assertions
  below are about the world after the second request, not about the status code
  it returned:

    * a create retried with one key leaves **one** endpoint, and the second
      response is the first response byte for byte — including the `whsec_`
      secret, which exists nowhere else and cannot be re-derived;
    * a ping retried with one key sends **nothing** the second time, asserted by
      clearing the recording sender and finding nothing recorded;
    * a request that did not succeed leaves **no row**, so the retry runs.

  The last one is the assertion that a failed request is not pinned for a day, and
  it is the reason a 4xx is not stored. See `Courier.Idempotency`'s moduledoc.
