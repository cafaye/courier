defmodule CourierWeb.ErrorRelayEndpointTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The error-ingestion surface, over real requests, through `CourierWeb.ErrorRouter`.

  ## Why it is not on `CourierWeb.Router`

  Because it is not a customer API operation and putting it there would have cost
  something this repository will not pay. Everything on `/v1` takes a cafaye
  principal resolved from a bearer token; this surface takes a **shared ingest
  secret**, because a Sentry SDK holds a DSN and there is no identity service in
  that path to mint a JWT. A generated client from `openapi.yaml` must not have
  it, and a route on the public router would have needed a third entry in
  `CourierWeb.OpenAPIDocumentTest`'s exclusion list — which is weakening an
  existing check to accommodate new code, and the brief rules that out.

  So the surface is a **second listener** (`CourierWeb.ErrorEndpoint`, its own
  port) and the bidirectional router↔document test is untouched. That is the
  deciding reason and it is worth stating, because "put it on the other endpoint"
  is otherwise a detail.

  ## What these tests hold

    * the shared secret is **required** and its default is *refuse*, not allow;
    * a wrong, absent, or repeated header is `401` with core's `problem+json` and
      a body that does not distinguish "no token configured" from "wrong token";
    * the relay's own health check is **not** behind the secret, and does not
      consult a dependency — a probe behind auth reads as a dead component;
    * a body the relay cannot read is a counted discard and a `200`, never a
      non-2xx, because the Sentry SDK retries every non-2xx and a `400` for a
      malformed envelope is a retry storm in the service that sent it;
    * an oversized body is refused **before** it is read.

  `async: true`: it changes no application env and starts no shared process. The
  relay it posts to is started per test with `start_supervised!/1`, so no state
  outlives a test.

  # `post/3` on a connection built by `build_conn/0` dispatches to **`@endpoint`**,
  # which `CourierWeb.ConnCase` sets to `CourierWeb.Endpoint` — the customer API,
  # not the error endpoint. Re-declaring `@endpoint CourierWeb.ErrorEndpoint` below
  # the `use` does not help, because the `using` block has already injected its own
  # `@endpoint` and the *helper* is what reads it. So every request in this file
  # was being sent to a router with no route for it, and the router's 404 rendered
  # as a `200` with an empty body on the error endpoint's error renderer — which
  # looks exactly like "the plug let it through".
  #
  # `Plug.Test.conn/3` and `CourierWeb.ErrorEndpoint.call/2`, for two reasons
  # neither of which is style.
  #
  #   * The **endpoint is named per request.** `Phoenix.ConnTest`'s `post/3`
  #     dispatches to `@endpoint`, which `CourierWeb.ConnCase` sets to
  #     `CourierWeb.Endpoint` — the *customer API*, which has no route for this
  #     path. Re-declaring `@endpoint` below the `use` does not help, because the
  #     `using` block has already injected one and the helper is what reads it. So
  #     every request went to a router with no matching route and the 404 rendered
  #     as `200 {}` on the error endpoint's error renderer — indistinguishable,
  #     from the assertion, from "the token plug let it through".
  #   * **The body has to be on the connection.** `dispatch/5`'s fifth argument is
  #     *params*, and an envelope is a binary body, not a map. Passing the envelope
  #     as params produced an empty request body, `parse_envelope/1` refused it,
  #     and the relay correctly forwarded nothing — so a test asserting on the
  #     forwarded bytes failed while every status assertion passed.
  # `\\ []` is never used — every call site passes `relay:`, and the two that
  # do not are the hand-built connections below. Removed rather than left as a

  #   * `env: [target: :prod]`. `runtime.exs` guards its prod blocks with
  #     `config_env() == :prod`, and `config_env()` reads the reader's `:target`.
  #     Without it the reader is evaluating this test environment's file and the
  #     prod blocks never run — which is a config that looks fine and answers
  #     `server: false` for a reason that has nothing to do with the assertion.
  #   * The `PHX_SERVER` variable in the **real** environment, not in `env:`.
  #     `runtime.exs` calls `System.get_env("PHX_SERVER")`, and `Config.Reader`'s
  #     `:env` option does not satisfy `System.get_env/1` — it supplies variables
  #     for `env`-style config reading. Measured: with `:env` given and the
  #     variable unset, the reader returned no `:server` key at all, which is a
  #     green-looking result for the wrong reason.
  #
  # `System.put_env/2` is restored in `on_exit`. This file is `async: true` and the
  # environment is the whole VM, so the window is real — which is the honest cost of
  # reading a `System.get_env/1` branch without a subprocess, and why the restore is
  # in `on_exit` rather than after the call (an assertion failure must still restore).
