# courier — production image.
#
# Generated with `mix phx.gen.release --docker` and trimmed: this repository
# ships no assets and no LiveView, so there is no node/esbuild/tailwind stage
# here. The Elixir and OTP versions below MUST match mise.toml; they are the two
# pins that decide whether a local `mix test` and a deployed image are the same
# program.
#
# The release carries its own ERTS, so the final stage is a slim Debian with no
# Erlang, no Elixir, and no build toolchain in it.
#
# These images are based on:
#
#   - https://hub.docker.com/r/hexpm/elixir/tags - for the builder image
#     E.g.: docker.io/hexpm/elixir:1.20.4-erlang-29.1.1-debian-trixie-20260918-slim
#   - https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/tags?name=trixie-20260918-slim - for the runner image
#     E.g.: docker.io/debian:trixie-20260918-slim
#
# Find builder and runner images on Docker Hub or on Hex's Build Server (Bob).
# We recommend using Bob's Web UI to find recent tags:
#
#   - https://bob.hex.pm/docker?repo=hexpm/elixir&os=debian&sort=elixir_version,erlang_version,os_version
#
# We suggest using the same Debian version for both the builder and runner images.
#
# We suggest Debian/Ubuntu instead of Alpine to avoid production compatibility issues
# (such as DNS resolution failures, and dynamically linked NIFs/precompiled binaries).
#
# For finding packages in Debian, search on https://packages.debian.org/.
