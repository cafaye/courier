defmodule Courier.NotificationPreferences do
  @moduledoc """
  What a user has been asked to receive, per notification type.

  This is courier's one piece of per-user state, and the only thing standing
  between a user and mail they asked not to receive. Three rules make it safe to
  read:

    * **Silence is not consent.** A user courier has never seen, or a type a user
      has never mentioned, is on. courier does not own users, so "no row" is the
      normal case, not an error — `list/2` returns every type, on, for an id it
      has never been asked about.
    * **One type off is not every type off.** Preferences are per type and per
      channel, and `enabled?/3` reads exactly the one it was asked about.
    * **A preference is the user's, and it belongs to an account.** `list/2` and
      `update/3` take the calling account and answer `{:error, :not_found}` for a
      user whose rows belong to somebody else, which is the whole of the
      authorization on the two routes that call them. The 404 is deliberately
      narrow: it appears only once rows exist, because until then courier has
      nothing to say about the user at all and inventing a "belongs to another
      account" out of an empty table would be a 404 that leaks the emptiness.

  `push` is stored and returned because the API is the user's settings and a
  half-answer is worse than none, but it is not a delivery decision courier can
  act on: nothing sends push, so `enabled?(user, type, :push)` is always false.

  A rejected batch writes nothing. The entries are validated together before any
  of them is stored, so a typo in the third entry cannot leave the first two
  applied and the user looking at a half-saved settings page.

  ## The first write claims the user, and that is a real limitation

  courier cannot ask identity which account a user belongs to: `user_id` is a
  uuid with no foreign key here and there is no client to ask with. So the
  account is recorded by whoever writes first, and it is the account the rows
  belong to from then on.

  That is a bounded weakness rather than a good design, and it is worth stating
  in full. An account that writes preferences for a user id nobody has written
  for can **claim** that user: it gains no access to anything that existed, and
  the account that actually owns the user then gets a 404 and a settings page
  that cannot save. So the rule is "the first authenticated `PUT` wins", not
  "the right `PUT` wins", and the second is the one the platform wants.

  It is still the right rule for courier today, because the alternative is not a
  better answer but no answer: a service that cannot resolve ownership can
  either let the first writer claim the resource, or refuse every write forever.
  When identity's membership question is reachable on the hot path, this is the
  comparison to add — and it is a comparison, not a new source of truth, because
  the column is already where the claim is recorded.

  ## Why `enabled?/3` takes no account

  It is the delivery path, and delivery is addressed by a user: `Courier.Deliver`
  is handed a payload with a `user_id` and no account, and a user id is a global
  uuid from identity. There is also exactly one row per `(user, type)` — the
  account is the row's owner, not part of its identity — so there is nothing for
  an account to disambiguate. Threading one through would have meant inventing an
  account for a payload that does not carry one.

  `params` is the request body: `%{"preferences" => [%{"notification_type" =>

  Returns `{:ok, preferences}` — the same shape as `list/2`, so a caller can
  answer a `PUT` with the state the user now has — `{:error, :not_found}` when
  the user belongs to another account, or `{:error, changeset}`, where the errors
  name the field that failed and, through
  `CourierWeb.NotificationPreferencesController`, the entry of the batch it was
  in. A rejected batch stores nothing.

  The tenancy check is **first**, before the batch is looked at, which is the
  order `Courier.WebhookEndpoints` uses and the only safe one: a 422 about a
  caller's own body leaks nothing, but answering it for a user the caller cannot
  see would confirm that the user has preferences before the 404 gets a chance to
  withhold it.
