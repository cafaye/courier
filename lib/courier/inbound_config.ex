defmodule Courier.InboundConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  The signing secrets courier verifies inbound webhooks with, and the refusal to
  boot without one.

  ## This is a *verification* secret, and it is not the outbound one

  courier signs outbound deliveries with a secret it generates per endpoint
  (`Courier.WebhookEndpoints`, sealed under `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`) and
  verifies inbound reports with a secret **the provider generated and courier was
  given**. They are different secrets for different directions, they live in
  different systems — one in courier's database, one in the provider's dashboard
  — and conflating them would mean a deployment that leaks a customer's outbound
  secret can also forge inbound suppressions. So the two are configured
  separately and this module says so where the variable is read.

  ## Why a secret is REQUIRED in production

  Unset, `Courier.Inbound.Signature.verify/4` answers `:invalid_secret` for every
  request, the route answers 500, and **every hard bounce and every complaint
  courier is sent is discarded** — silently enough that the suppression table
  stays empty, `POST /v1/messages` keeps mailing addresses that have permanently
  refused, and a sending domain's reputation dies of a cause nothing in a
  dashboard names. That is precisely the failure `Courier.Suppressions` was
  written to prevent, arriving through the door that was supposed to prevent it.

  So `config/runtime.exs` **refuses to boot** a production courier without it,
  on the argument `Courier.MailerAdapter` makes: a courier that is running and
  cannot do the thing is worse than one that will not start, because the damage is
  invisible. A default would be worse than nothing — a secret in version control
  that every deployment which forgot to set one would accept forged suppressions
  under, which is an unauthenticated `POST` that mails nobody.

  **Test and development are not refused**, and the reason is that they are not a
  deployment. `config/test.exs` sets a fixed test-only value in the same sense as
  `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY`'s, and a developer running `mix phx.server` without a
  provider webhook configured is not shipping anything. Both are visible states:
  a request to the route in either environment is a 500 naming the variable, not a
  silent success.

  ## One variable per provider, named for the provider

  `COURIER_INBOUND_RESEND_SECRET` rather than one shared `COURIER_INBOUND_SECRET`,
  because a second provider will need a second secret and a shared variable cannot
  hold both: it would make the second provider's configuration an edit to the
  first's, and a deployment that added Postmark would be one keystroke away from
  verifying Postmark's traffic with Resend's key. It is read into a map keyed by
  the provider, so the route looks up the one it is for and a missing one is a
  `nil` rather than a wrong secret.

  Rotating it means the old and the new are both valid for as long as the
  provider will send the old one. Svix's `v1` scheme supports a **space-delimited**
  signature list for exactly this, and `Courier.Inbound.Signature` already reads
  every entry and tries each — so a rotation is a provider-side change followed by
  a redeploy, and there is a window in which both work by design rather than by
  luck.

  @doc """
  The secret configured for `provider`, or `nil`.

  The lookup key is a **string**, and that is the whole reason it is not an atom:
  the key comes from the request's path (`/inbound/resend`), and an atom keyed on
  caller-supplied text is `String.to_existing_atom/1` on the request path of a
  route, which is either a crash on a path courier has not seen or — with
  `String.to_atom/1` — an unbounded atom table fed by whoever finds the URL. The
  path is a closed set because `CourierWeb.Router` matches it against a literal,
  so an atom would work; a string works for the same reason and cannot go wrong
  if that ever changes.
