  RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe: the header on the message, and the door it opens.

  Gmail's and Yahoo's bulk-sender requirements (in force since June 2024) are
  about a `List-Unsubscribe` header whose HTTPS URI a mail client POSTs to on the
  recipient's behalf, with no session and no human in the loop. A courier that
  sends bulk mail without it is a courier whose bulk mail lands in spam, so this is
  the deliverability gate rather than a feature.

      iex> {:ok, message} = decorate_for(:product_update, user_id, message)
      iex> message.headers["List-Unsubscribe-Post"]
      "List-Unsubscribe=One-Click"

  ## What RFC 8058 requires, and where each half lives here

  | § | requirement | this module |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 3.1 | one `List-Unsubscribe` header containing one **HTTPS** URI | `decorate/2` |
  | 3.1 | one `List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` | `decorate/2` |
  | 3.1 | the URI carries an opaque, hard-to-forge component | `Courier.UnsubscribeToken` |
  | 3.1 | the POST must not carry cookies or authorization | `CourierWeb.UnsubscribeController` |
  | 3.1 | **the sender must not return a redirect** | the controller answers 200 in place |
  | 3.2 | the receiver POSTs to the same URI a person would GET | one route, two verbs |
  | 4 | DKIM covering both headers, in the `h=` tag | **not courier's — see below** |

  **§4 is the one requirement this repository does not meet, and it cannot.**
  RFC 8058 §4 requires a valid DKIM signature covering `List-Unsubscribe` and
  `List-Unsubscribe-Post` and listed in `h=`, and §3.2 says a receiver that finds
  no such signature "SHOULD NOT offer a one-click unsubscribe for that message".
  courier submits through `Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP` to a relay and holds no private
  key for the sending domain, so the signing is the relay's — the same place SPF,
  DMARC and everything else about the sending domain lives. The consequence is
  worth stating rather than hiding: **if the relay does not DKIM-sign, the header
  is on the wire and the mail client ignores it.** That is an operational fact
  about the relay, and the header is not a substitute for it.

  ## The URL is courier's own public URL, and it is built from the endpoint

  `base_url/0` reads `CourierWeb.Endpoint.url/0` rather than taking a setting, and
  the reason is that there is no other honest source: the one an operator sets is
  `PHX_HOST`, which `config/runtime.exs` already turns into
  `url: [host: host, port: 443, scheme: "https"]`. So in production the header
  courier writes is an **HTTPS** URI as §3.1 requires, and it is the same host
  Phoenix uses for its own generated URLs — one setting, one answer, and no
  variable that can be right for the endpoint and wrong for the header.

  `Courier.UnsubscribeHeadersTest` asserts the scheme from **production's
  configuration** rather than from this paragraph.

  ## What an unsubscribe writes

  It writes a row in `email_suppressions` with `provider: "unsubscribe"`, a
  `reason`, the address, the notification type, the user, and **no `state`** — plus
  a `courier.notification.suppressed` event in the same transaction. The
  idempotency is the same `(provider, provider_event_id)` unique index every
  provider report uses, keyed on the token's id, so a second `POST` is a
  `:duplicate` rather than a second row.

  ### The state-less row is the whole mechanism, and it is the load-bearing part

  A bounce and a complaint carry a `state` and refuse **every** notification type
  courier sends, because they are facts about the MAILBOX. `Courier.Deliver`
  consults this table for a password reset exactly as firmly as it does for a
  newsletter. An unsubscribe is an instruction about **one** type, so it carries
  no state at all:

      state: nil   ->  invisible to Courier.Suppressions.state/1
                   ->  invisible to find/1 and to suppressed?/1
                   ->  visible to Suppressions.unsubscribed?(email, type)

  A `nil` state is not a new shape for this table: the fold in `state/1` already
  ignores rows with no state, and that is exactly how a soft bounce "records
  nothing". So the precedence the moduledoc boasts — "`:suppressed` outranks
  `:undeliverable`, and a later bounce cannot withdraw a complaint" — is
  **untouched**, and so is every query on the table.

  And the alternative was measured rather than assumed. Writing the unsubscribe as
  a `notification_preferences` row — which is what "the user's own answer" sounds
  like, and which is what the first draft of this packet did — is **not
  available**: that table's `account_id` is `NOT NULL`, and the account is
  recorded by whoever writes first. An unsubscribe has no principal, so the row
  would have to carry the account that sent the mail, which is a **tenancy claim**
  made for a user id an authenticated caller chose. Two accounts could then
  disagree about who owns a person's settings, and the account that actually owns
  the user would get a 404 from a route that worked yesterday. Writing the answer
  where the table has no tenancy column at all is the direction in which the worst
  case is "the user stops getting this one kind of mail".

  ### What it costs, stated rather than discovered

  **The answer is immutable and no route removes it.** `Courier.Suppressions`'s
  rows are immutable by design and this is one of them, so a recipient who
  unsubscribes from a product update in error cannot put it back through any
  surface courier has, and the only remedy today is another address. That is a
  real cost and it belongs with the first bulk type rather than with this
  endpoint: a route that clears an unsubscribe is one `DELETE` on this table and
  an authenticated caller, and it is deliberately **not** added here — a delete on
  an immutable table is a decision about what "immutable" means, and it is not one
  to make in the same commit as the thing it would undo. The alternative costs
  more than it saves: courier sends no bulk mail today, so nothing is being taken
  away from anybody yet, whereas a wrong tenancy claim breaks a route that works.

  The `reason` is what makes the row readable to an operator: it says who wrote it
  and why, which is the same reason `reason` exists for a provider's own words.

  ## Why the event is `courier.notification.suppressed` and not a new type

  `Courier.Events` has carried a builder for `courier.notification.suppressed`
  since courier-01, and `cafaye.yml` has declared the type, with no caller — the
  moduledoc says so and says the sentence to argue with is `Courier.Deliver`'s
  "no mail, no event, no record of a send that did not happen". It is not
  contradicted here: **this is not a send that was refused, it is a standing
  answer that changed**, and the type's schema is exactly that —
  `subject` the user id, `data` `user_id` / `notification_type` / `email` /
  `reason`, and **no `message_id`**, because no message was rendered and there is
  none to name. `reason` is `preference_off`, one of the three values core's
  `suppressed.schema.json` freezes, and it is the right one of the three: the user
  turned the type off.

  A new event type would have needed a core payload schema this repository does
  not own, and would have left the one courier already declares with its first
  caller still empty.

  ## Idempotency is the unique index, and the second POST is a 200

  An MUA is entitled to retry: a `POST` that timed out is a `POST` courier cannot
  distinguish from one that worked. So the second call answers the **same 200 with
  the same body**, writes nothing, and publishes nothing — `{:ok, :duplicate, row}`
  from the index courier already had, and the event is published only on `:new`.
  The alternative, a 409, would send the mail client round a retry loop over
  something that is already true, which is the argument
  `Courier.InboundReports` makes about a redelivered provider report and the same
  argument in a different table.

  There is no `Idempotency-Key` here, for the reason `POST /inbound/resend` has
  none: the header is scoped to a principal, and this route has none by RFC 8058
  §3.1's own instruction that the request carry no authorization at all.

  ## A token is minted per message, and lives in the send's transaction

  `decorate_for/3` is called by `Courier.Deliver` inside the transaction that sends
  the mail, so a provider that refuses rolls the token row back with the send. A
  token for a message nobody received is a live credential for an unsubscribe
  nobody was ever offered, which is the same "row that lies" the outbox exists to
  prevent.

  ## And no bulk message goes out today

  All three of courier's types are `:transactional` — see `Courier.Mailers.kinds/0`
  for why, which includes that adding a bulk type is a change in **core** rather
  than here. So `decorate_for/3` returns the message untouched for every type
  courier can currently send, and that is asserted over real rendered messages for
  all three. The positive half of the gate is asserted where it can be asserted
  honestly: on a real rendered message the function decorates, and on the wire a
  real SMTP server received.
