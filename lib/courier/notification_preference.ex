defmodule Courier.NotificationPreference do
  @moduledoc """
  One user's answer about one notification type: is this channel on for this
  person.

  `user_id` is a uuid from identity with no foreign key — courier does not own
  users, and a preference for a user it has never seen is its normal case
  (there is no `users` table here to point at).

  `account_id` is **who is entitled to this answer**, not part of what the answer
  is. A user has one set of preferences whatever route they were written through,
  so the row is still keyed by `(user_id, notification_type)`; the account is what
  `Courier.NotificationPreferences.list/2` and `update/3` compare a caller against
  before answering, and it comes from the principal. Without it the two routes
  were reachable by anybody who could type a `user_id` into a path — the whole
  reason this column exists.

  The absence of a row is also an answer: every channel is on unless the user
  turned it off. `Courier.NotificationPreferences.list/2` is what turns that
  default into rows, and it does not write them — a GET must not have a side
  effect.
