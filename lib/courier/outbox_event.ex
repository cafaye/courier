  One row per emission, written in the same transaction as the send that caused
  it — the whole point of the outbox (`core/docs/event-outbox.md`): a mail that
  went out is a row the platform can see, and a row the platform cannot see did
  not go out.

  The `id` is the envelope's `id`, generated before the insert and reused on
  every republish, so a consumer that deduplicates on `id` actually dedupes.

  `published_at` is the only definition of published — not "attempted", not
  "handed to a client" — and it is set from the publisher's acknowledgement, in
  `Courier.Workers.ProcessOutboxWorker`, never here.
