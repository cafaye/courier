defmodule Courier.Health do
  @moduledoc """
  Liveness and readiness for courier.

  Liveness is answered by the web layer alone (`GET /healthz`); it says the VM
  is up and the endpoint can dispatch. Readiness (`GET /readyz`) says the
  service can actually do work, which right now means the database answers a
  query.

  Delivery in courier is at-least-once (PLAN.md §3), so a readiness check that
  raises would take out the whole endpoint rather than the one request. Every
  failure mode — repo not started, pool gone, connection refused, auth
  rejected, timeout — is folded into an error tuple here, once.

  How long a failure takes, measured in the release image against
  `postgres:17`: with the repo not running, `ready?/1` raises and returns
  immediately. With a database that went away underneath a running pool, the
  answer waits for the pool to give up — about 4.4s, from DBConnection's queue
  backpressure, not from the query `timeout` below. `:queue_target` and
  `:queue_interval` are pool state rather than per-call options, so a probe
  cannot shorten that without reconfiguring every query in the service. The
  verdict is right either way: an orchestrator whose probe times out reads
  courier as not ready, which is what it is. Leave the pool alone.
