defmodule Courier.Principal.Introspection.Document do
  @moduledoc """
  What courier makes of identity's answer to `POST /v1/introspections`.

  A pure function of the body. No socket, no configuration, no clock — which is
  the reason this is a module of its own rather than a private function inside
  `Courier.Principal.Introspection`: every rule below is then a table over a
  literal, and the resolver's own tests are left holding the one question they are
  about.

  ## Three answers, and the second one is the interesting one

      {:ok, principal}      a live token, with an account courier can place
      :error                identity says the token cannot be used — a 401
      {:error, :unreadable} identity did not answer in a shape courier reads — a 503

  The split between the second and the third is the whole design. `:error` means
  **identity answered the question** and the answer was no; `{:error, :unreadable}`
  means **courier could not read the answer**, which is courier's problem rather
  than the caller's. Collapsing them is the one mistake available here, and it is
  the mistake that tells a caller holding a perfectly good token that their token
  is the problem — which is a lie that costs a rotation, a support ticket and an
  engineer an afternoon.

  ## `:error` is ONE answer for every reason a token is unusable

  Unknown, revoked, expired, and one whose owner has been removed from the account
  are all `200 {"active": false}` upstream — identity collapsed them on purpose,
  because a caller who can tell them apart learns whether a leaked value is still
  live. **Nothing here re-expands them.** There is no branch on `exp`, no branch
  on a `revoked` claim, and no clock in this module, which is the structural
  reason the four cannot come apart here.

  ## `account_id` is the only tenancy key, and there is no `sub` fallback

  `sub` is the **user** a token names. `account_id` is the tenancy boundary and it
  is required. A document that is active and carries no `account_id` is therefore
  a caller courier cannot place, and it is answered exactly as an inactive token
  is: `:error`.

  `Map.fetch/2` with no default, and that is not a style choice — it is what makes
  the fallback inexpressible in the one function that decides the account. The
  subject is read two functions below and is a perfectly good uuid, which is
  exactly why a fallback would be so easy to write by accident.

  ## `scopes` and `scope` are both read, because the fleet has not chosen

  MD7 in the manager's `DECISIONS.md` is open: core's conventions require
  `scopes`, guard's verifier reads `scope`, and identity emits **both, byte for
  byte** so that whichever name wins is a one-line removal and no credential has
  to be reissued. courier therefore reads the union and assumes neither is the
  only one. A resolver that read one name would work perfectly until MD7 is ruled,
  and then work perfectly for nobody.

  A claim that is present and is **not a string** is `{:error, :unreadable}`
  rather than an empty set. That is the load-bearing half of the rule: the array
  shape is the one a losing side of MD7 could plausibly adopt, and reading an
  array as "no scopes" is the silent version of the bug — a token holding
  `["webhooks:write"]` would authenticate and appear to hold nothing, which is the
  one reading nobody can debug afterwards.

  A document carrying **neither** name is an empty set, deliberately. RFC 7662
  makes the claim optional, identity's `IntrospectionResponse` requires only
  `active`, and refusing would mean inventing a requirement identity does not
  state. The cost is written down in the test that asserts it: if identity ever
  stopped emitting both, every caller would still authenticate on `account_id`
  alone, and nothing would say so.
