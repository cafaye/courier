defmodule Courier.Principal.Introspection do
  @moduledoc """
  courier's door, and the key it turns.

  `config :courier, :principal` names this module when courier is not in test, and
  it answers the one question `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal` asks: who is calling.

  ## What courier presents to introspect — the first judgement call

  **`COURIER_IDENTITY_TOKEN`, a scoped API token courier holds as its own
  credential**, presented as `Authorization: Bearer` on identity's
  `POST /v1/introspections`; the caller's presented token goes in the **body**.

  It is a service credential and it is treated as one:

    * **It comes from the environment, at boot, and nowhere else.** Not argv —
      `kamal`'s `env.secret` is a secret read from the environment, and anything
      on a command line is in `ps` output and in the shell history of whoever
      deployed. Not a config file: a committed value is a value in git.
    * **It is never logged, never echoed, and never part of a reason.** Every
      refusal below is a symbol; `test/courier/principal/introspection_test.exs`
      captures real log output and asserts the token is ABSENT, which is the
      assertion worth more than "it logged something" — a boundary that deletes
      everything passes that.
    * **Rotation is identity's, not courier's.** Mint a new key
      (`POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/api-keys`), redeploy with the new value,
      revoke the old one. There is no cache to invalidate, which is the second
      half of why there is no cache (below).

  ## Why the credential is not the caller's own token, forwarded

  RFC 7662 §2.1 permits a protected resource to introspect using the token
  itself, and identity implements exactly that affordance — "a token may
  introspect **itself**". So courier *could* forward the caller's credential and
  ask about itself, which would need no second secret at all. It does not, and the
  reason is that the affordance only covers the one token identity is holding:

      mayIntrospect: a token caller may read ITSELF and nothing else.

  Any other tenant's token is a 403. Forwarding the caller's credential would
  therefore work **only** for the single account that happens to own courier's own
  service token, which is a door that is shut for every real tenant and open for
  exactly one — the worst shape a credential can have. See the packet report:
  identity's contract as implemented has no credential a service can use to
  introspect an arbitrary tenant token, and courier's resolver reports that as a
  **503** rather than pretending otherwise.

  ## Nothing is cached, and the cost of that is stated rather than assumed

  Every authenticated request is one extra round trip to identity, on the hot
  path. Caching is not an option that was weighed and declined on latency: a
  cached introspection answer is a **revocation that has not taken effect yet**,
  and the answer courier would serve from it is `account_id` — so a cached entry
  is an account-scoped grant that survives the operator revoking the credential.
  The alternative, a short TTL, is the same hole with a timer on it.

  What that costs is real and is the price of this design: **courier's API
  latency now includes identity's, and identity's outage is courier's outage.**
  Both show up as a 503, which is a retryable status on the caller's side.

  ## Failure is a closed door

  identity unreachable, slow, 5xx, 401, 403, or answering in a shape courier
  cannot read is `{:error, :unavailable}`, which the plug turns into a **503**.
  Never "allow the request": a resolver that fails open under load is worse than
  `Courier.Principal.Reject`, because it fails *silently*.

  And identity's own **401 and 403 are courier's problem, not the caller's**,
  which is why they are a 503 rather than a 401. identity answers 401 when the
  credential *courier* presented is not one it accepts, and 403 when that
  credential may not ask about the token it named. Both are facts about this
  deployment. Reporting either as a 401 tells a customer to rotate a token that
  was never the problem, and an operator reads a wall of "invalid credentials"
  when the fault is one environment variable.

  ## The three answers, and what each one costs the caller

      {:ok, principal}              a live token with an account courier can place
      :error                        identity said no — a 401, one answer for every
                                    reason a token is unusable
      {:error, :unavailable}        courier could not find out — a 503

  ## Where the token comes off the request

  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and nothing else. **Not** the `__Host-session`
  cookie: that is identity's browser surface, core's conventions put cookies on
  that surface and not on API traffic, and courier has no session of its own to
  hang one on. A request with no bearer is refused **without calling identity** —
  which is not an optimisation, it is what stops an unauthenticated endpoint being
  a load generator aimed at a dependency.
