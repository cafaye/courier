defmodule Courier.Webhooks.UrlGuard do
  @moduledoc """
  The check every webhook URL passes before courier will sign a request to it.

  courier holds a signing secret and will HMAC a request to any URL an account
  registers. That is an SSRF machine: whoever can create an endpoint can reach
  anything courier can reach, with courier's network position and courier's
  credentials on the wire. Standard Webhooks §Server side request forgery names
  the same risk and says the protection is "to prevent the webhooks from calling
  into internal networks and services".

  ## What is refused, and why each one is a target

  | refused | why it matters |
  | ------- | -------------- |
  | `file:`, `ftp:`, `gopher:`, `data:`, `javascript:` and no scheme at all | not HTTP; a client that follows one of these is reading courier's filesystem or talking a protocol nobody expected |
  | loopback `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `0.0.0.0`, `::` | courier's own process, and every sidecar, admin port and debug server sharing the host |
  | link-local `169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10` | the cloud instance metadata service. It answers on `169.254.169.254` and hands out credentials for everything else in the account |
  | `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `fc00::/7` | the service network: databases, caches, internal APIs, and the other cafaye services |
  | `::ffff:0:0/96` mapped onto any of the above | the same addresses wearing an IPv6 costume |
  | `localhost` and `*.localhost`, `*.local` | names that resolve to loopback by rule, before any DNS answer is involved |

  `172.16.0.0/12` is the whole range, `172.15` and `172.32` included on the
  outside: a guard that refused "172." wholesale would be turning away real
  customers' hosts, and the tests say so.

  ## The part that actually stops the attack

  The string is not the target, the *resolved address* is. So `validate/2`
  resolves the host and refuses the URL when **any** answer is blocked — a name
  that answers with one public and one private address is the DNS-rebinding
  shape, and a guard that inspected only the first answer would wave it through.

  And the value it returns is that resolved address, which the sender dials
  directly with the original name as the `Host` header. That closes the gap
  between "the address I checked" and "the address I connected to": if the guard
  returned the hostname for the sender to re-resolve, the check would be
  decorative and a second lookup would do whatever the attacker wanted. The
  sender therefore has no way to connect somewhere the guard did not approve,
  and a `Host` header of the resolved address would break every virtual host
  this would otherwise work against.

  This is a guard, not a network boundary. Spec §Server side request forgery
  recommends running the webhook workers in their own subnet as well; that is
  deployment, not this module, and courier's Dockerfile is the place for it.
