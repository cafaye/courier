defmodule Courier.Webhooks.Signature do
  @moduledoc """
  The Standard Webhooks signature, byte for byte as
  `moon/refs/standard-webhooks/spec/standard-webhooks.md` specifies it.

  PLAN.md §7 adopted the spec for courier's outbound webhooks and said "No
  custom scheme", so this module has no opinions of its own. Every name, every
  delimiter, and every encoding below is the spec's:

  | what | spec section | value |
  | ---- | ------------ | ----- |
  | base string | §Signature scheme | `msg_id.timestamp.payload` — "the message's: ID, timestamp and body are concatenated (delimited by full-stops)" |
  | algorithm | §Signature scheme, symmetric row | `HMAC-SHA256` |
  | signature identifier | §Signature scheme, symmetric row | `v1` |
  | serialized signature | §Signature scheme | `v1,<base64>`, space-delimited when there is more than one |
  | secret serialization | §Signature scheme, symmetric row | `whsec_` + base64, random, 24–64 bytes |
  | headers | §Webhook headers | `webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, `webhook-signature` |

  Two rules from the spec are load-bearing and easy to break:

    * **The bytes that are sent are the bytes that are signed.** The spec warns
      at §Signature scheme that "even a stray space can cause the signature to be
      invalid", so this module signs a `payload` binary the caller already has,
      and never a term it re-encodes for its own convenience. `headers/4` takes
      the same binary the sender puts on the wire.
    * **Neither the id nor the timestamp may contain a full stop.** The spec says
      so directly: a `.` in the id would let a caller append fields to the base
      string. `new_id/0` generates ids that cannot, and the verifier refuses an
      id that does.

  `Courier.Webhooks.Verifier` is the other half: what a consumer of a courier
  webhook runs, kept next to the signer so the two cannot drift.
