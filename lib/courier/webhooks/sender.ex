defmodule Courier.Webhooks.Sender do
  @moduledoc """
  The behaviour courier's webhook delivery sends through, and the result it comes
  back as.

  A behaviour rather than a direct `Req` call for the same reason
  `Courier.NatsPublisher` is one: the classification rules below — what counts as
  a success, what is worth retrying, what a `410` means — are courier's policy
  and can be tested without a socket in the room.

  ## What counts as a failure, and what is worth repeating

  The spec §Delivery success and failure is the whole list, and courier follows it
  rather than inventing a retry rule:

  | response | success | retried | why |
  | -------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
  | `2xx` | yes | — | the definition |
  | `3xx` | no | no | "Following redirects causes unnecessary load on both the sender and the receiver, it's therefore recommended to update the webhook URL instead" |
  | `410 Gone` | no | no | the receiver "should disable the webhook endpoint, and stop sending it messages" |
  | `408`, `429` | no | yes | a timeout and a rate limit both mean "not now" |
  | other `4xx` | no | no | the request is wrong and will stay wrong |
  | `5xx` | no | yes | the receiver is having a bad time |
  | no response | no | yes | nothing answered, which is not evidence the url is wrong |

  `retry_after_seconds` carries the consumer's `Retry-After` so the schedule can
  honour it — the spec asks for that explicitly. It is read only in the
  delta-seconds form; a date form is absent rather than misread as a number.

  ## Why the result is a struct and not a bare status code

  Because the caller needs four things and a status code cannot hold them: whether
  it worked, what came back, how long it took, and what the receiver said about
  when to come back. Every one of those is recorded on the delivery row, and a
  tuple with four positions would be a tuple nobody can read at the call site.

    @moduledoc """
    What one attempt produced: a verdict, a status (or none), a duration, the
    consumer's `Retry-After`, and the transport error if there was no response at
    all.

    `status_code` is `nil` for a transport failure on purpose. A connection
    refused is not a `0` and is not a `503`; recording a number there would make
    "the receiver answered 500" and "the receiver never answered" the same row,
    and those two need different responses from whoever reads it.

  sender "should disable the webhook endpoint, and stop sending it messages".
  Anything else — a `404`, a `400` — might be a url the customer has not finished
  setting up, and disabling on a guess is how a working integration stops working.
