  The three things a span must get right, in one place.

  `record/2` is the one to read, and it exists for a reason that is worth stating
  plainly before the code.

  ## Why an allowlist at all

  Telemetry is the one place sensitive content leaks by accident. courier sends
  email on behalf of other services, signs webhooks with a secret, and holds a
  notification preference keyed to a user. A tracing backend is a searchable,
  retained, widely-readable store, and adding spans to courier adds a new
  destination for exactly the text courier's whole job is not to publish.

  The realistic way this leaks is not an attacker. It is a well-meaning engineer
  in six months adding `span.set_attribute("payload", params)` because it would
  help debug a delivery, in a service whose payloads are other customers' data.

  So the control is an **allowlist at one choke point**, not discipline at each
  call site. `record/2` is the only way an attribute reaches a span, and anything
  it does not recognise does not land. `test/courier/observability_test.exs`
  asserts on the list itself — including that no name in it contains a word that
  names content — and `test/courier/telemetry_canary_test.exs` drives a real
  request with a canary in every field a caller controls and asserts it appears
  nowhere in the rendered export.

  The collector's redaction processor is the SECOND control, not the first. An
  attribute that never leaves this node cannot leak even if the collector is
  misconfigured, and a service that exports a span carrying a caller's body and
  relies on the collector to take it back out is one control, not two.

  ## What is deliberately not here

    * `error.message`. A message is unbounded, it is a cardinality bomb on any
      metric derived from it, and on a service that renders mail it is a
      recipient's name by another route. `record_failure/4` sets the span's
      STATUS and the bounded error CLASS and never the message.
    * `url.path`, `url.full`, `url.query`. A query string is caller text by
      another name. The route TEMPLATE is the bounded stand-in.
    * `user_agent.*`, `net.peer.*`, `http.request.header.*`. Courier authenticates
      with a bearer token; a header attribute is a credential in a searchable
      store.

  A class is a grouping key, and the set is closed rather than a pattern for a

  twenty-seven characters, and one series per value, which on the metric side is a
  user id on a measurement wearing a different name.

  `_OTHER` is the only member outside the snake_case shape and it is the OTel
  well-known fallback. It exists so instrumentation is never FORCED to invent a

  Put attributes on a span, if they are allowed to be there.

  THE ONLY PATH from a value to a span in this service. Four filters, in order of
  how much they protect against:

    1. **Unknown name** — dropped. This is the one that catches a future
       `courier.payload`.
    2. **Impossible value for a known name** — dropped. A method outside
       core's eight, a status outside 100..599, a route that is not a template,
       an error class outside the closed vocabulary. A name being allowlisted is
       not a promise that any value under it is shippable, and a value is where
       both the cardinality and the content live.
    3. **Over-long string** — dropped, not truncated. A shortened route template
       matches no real endpoint, so it is a metric label that reads as "no
       traffic" on a route that is busy.
    4. **Non-scalar** — dropped. A list or a map can be a payload.

  Whether a string is a legal `http.route` value.

  A slash-led path of bounded length drawn from a small character set, and the
  character set is the load-bearing half: there is no `@`, no `?`, no `=` and no
  space in it, so a template cannot hold an email, a query string or a
  percent-encoded anything — the three shapes a caller most easily gets into a
  path.

  A character check rather than a regex, and the reason is worth the extra line: a
  `~r{...}` sigil cannot hold a character class containing `{` and `}` without the
  sigil's own brace counting getting confused, and the first version of this
  function did exactly that and would not compile. A route pattern legitimately
  contains both — Phoenix's own is `"/v1/webhook_endpoints/:id"` and core's schema
  allows `{param}` — so the class is not optional and the regex was the wrong tool
  for it.

  WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it cannot tell a route TEMPLATE from a concrete path.
  `/v1/webhook_endpoints/wh_01J9Z8QK…` matches exactly as
  `/v1/webhook_endpoints/:id` does, and no pattern over a path can separate them
  without the router's route table. That property is structural —
  `CourierWeb.Plugs.Telemetry` asks Phoenix for the matched route, which the
  router built from its own table — and
  `test/courier_web/plugs/telemetry_test.exs` asserts it on a real parameterised
  route.

  Mark a span ERRORED and attach the bounded error CLASS.

  Two decisions, and the second is the one people get wrong.

    1. The PREDICATE for "this is an error" is the span's status, not
       `error.type`. The fleet dashboard partitions by service, filters on
       `status = error`, and drills down by class — because a fleet-wide
       breakdown grouped by `error.type` is invalid however good it looks. A span
       whose status is unset is invisible to that filter however many error
       attributes it carries.

    2. `error.type` is the CLASS, never the message, and `otel_span.record_error/3`
       is deliberately NOT called: the Erlang SDK records
       `exception.message` and `exception.stacktrace`, which are unbounded, are on
       nobody's allowlist, and in a service that renders mail are a recipient's
       name by another route.

  A class outside the closed vocabulary collapses to `_OTHER` and the caller is
  told, so instrumentation is never silently wrong. A handled-and-retried failure
  is not recorded at all: a retry that succeeded is not an error, and recording
  it makes the error rate a lie.
