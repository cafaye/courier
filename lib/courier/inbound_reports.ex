defmodule Courier.InboundReports do
  @moduledoc """
  One provider report, recorded, and the event that announces it.

  `Courier.Inbound.handle/5` verifies a request, parses it, and calls
  `Courier.Suppressions.ingest/1` for every event. That is the whole library
  path and it is right for a caller with no HTTP surface. A route is not that
  caller: it has to know **which** of the three refusals it is answering, because
  the three are 401, 422 and 500 and a provider reacts to each differently. So
  the route calls the two steps itself, in the order `handle/5` documents, and
  this module owns everything after them.

  ## What is in one transaction, and what is not

  The suppression row and its event are written together, and both roll back
  together, because a row without its event is a fact the platform never hears
  about and an event without its row is a claim about a mailbox courier does not
  hold. The exception is deliberate and stated: **an event courier cannot build
  commits nothing away.** A report whose `Message-ID` is not one courier issued
  still records its suppression — that is the load-bearing half, and the address
  is not going to be mailed again whatever courier can say about which message it
  was — and the missing event is a log line instead of a rollback that would
  throw the row away with it.

  The soft bounce is the third outcome and it writes nothing at all:
  `{:ok, :ignored}`, a shape the caller has to be able to tell from a row that
  was written. `Courier.Suppressions` explains why: a caller that counted
  `:ignored` as a failure would retry forever, and one that counted it as `:new`
  would be counting a row that does not exist.

  ## Why a replay is answered and not refused

  A provider delivering the same report twice is **normal**: delivery is
  at-least-once, and `Courier.Suppressions`'s unique index on
  `(provider, provider_event_id)` is what makes a redelivery harmless. So the
  second delivery is a 200 saying `duplicates: 1`, not a 409 — a provider retrying
  a report courier already holds has done nothing wrong, and a non-2xx would send
  it round the retry loop the index just spared it.

  **The key is the report's own content, not the `webhook-id` header**, and that
  is a choice rather than an accident. Spec §Verifying signatures says "use the
  `webhook-id` header as an idempotency key", and courier does not, because one
  delivery can name **many** recipients: a broadcast carries a single `webhook-id`
  and a `to` of every address it reached, and keying on the header would collapse
  them into one report and record **one** suppression for addresses that all
  bounced. `Courier.Inbound.Resend` builds the key from the type, the provider's
  email id and the address, so a retry of one report is one row per address and a
  retry of a broadcast is still one row per address.

  ## Why there is no `Idempotency-Key` on the route

  Because the header a provider sends is the one courier does not accept, and a
  plug that stores a response keyed on a header nobody sends is a retry courier is
  not listening for. `CourierWeb.Plugs.Idempotency` is also scoped to a principal
  and this route has none, deliberately. The mechanism that does the work is
  `courier`'s own unique index, which is stronger than the header in the one case
  that matters — two deliveries of the same report under two different
  `webhook-id`s, which is what a provider that re-signs a retry does.

  ## And why the route is not behind `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal`

  Because a provider is not a tenant. Resend signs with Svix and sends no bearer
  token, so a principal would 401 every delivery; and the alternative — behind no
  plug at all — is an unauthenticated `POST` that records suppressions, which is a
  denial of service on the whole product delivered by the feature meant to prevent
  it. Core's conventions settle it: "Inbound webhooks are not JWT-authenticated:
  they are signed, per the sender's convention, and the receiver checks the
  signature before parsing."

  The row courier already holds for this exact report, or `nil`.

  ## Why this lookup exists at all, and it is a workaround

  `Courier.Suppressions.ingest/1` finds a duplicate by **inserting and catching
  the unique violation**, then reading the winning row back
  (`Courier.Suppressions.duplicate/1`). That is correct and it is the right shape
  — "A 'have I seen this?' check in Elixir would be a race; the index cannot be" —
  but it only works **outside** a transaction. PostgreSQL aborts a whole
  transaction on a statement error, so the read that follows the failed insert
  answers `25P02 current transaction is aborted` and the caller raises. Measured,
  not assumed:

      # outside a transaction
      Suppressions.ingest(event)  #=> {:ok, :new, row}  then  {:ok, :duplicate, row}

      # inside Repo.transaction/1
      Suppressions.ingest(event)  #=> ** (Postgrex.Error) 25P02

  A savepoint does not rescue it, and neither does rolling the savepoint back:
  the error is raised from inside `duplicate/1`'s `Repo.one/1`, before either
  could run. So a caller that needs suppression and event to be atomic — which is
  this module, and is the outbox's whole point — cannot reach the duplicate
  answer through `ingest/1` at all.

  So the replay is answered by **asking first**, and the unique index is still
  what makes it safe: the lookup can only ever be *wrong* in the direction of
  thinking a report is new, and the insert that follows then loses the index and
  the caller gets `{:error, changeset}` and rolls the whole transaction back. The
  provider's retry arrives, the lookup finds the row the winner wrote, and the
  retry is answered `:duplicate`. So the index is the arbiter exactly as
  `Courier.Suppressions` says it is, and the only cost of asking first is that a
  genuinely concurrent pair of identical deliveries costs one extra retry.

  **The honest alternative was a savepoint per event and it does not work**, which
  is the whole reason this is a lookup and not a nested transaction.

  # not going to invent them — a `courier.email.bounced` whose `user_id` is `null`
  # is a payload that fails core's own schema on the bus, and a bus consumer
  # rejecting it is a worse outcome than not publishing.
  #
  # So courier **looks the send up**. `outbox_events.subject` is the message id
  # `Courier.Deliver` chose and wrote into the RFC 5322 `Message-ID` header, and
  # that row's `data` is the four fields the event needs, already validated at the
