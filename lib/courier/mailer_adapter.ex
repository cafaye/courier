defmodule Courier.MailerAdapter do
  @moduledoc """
  courier's provider adapter, and the refusal that makes the wrong one unreachable.

  A buyer installs courier, sets their SMTP credentials, sends a notification,
  and it arrives. That sentence was not true before this module existed:
  `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` renders a message into memory and returns a
  provider-shaped id without opening a socket, so a released courier accepted
  every send and mailed nobody. No error, no warning, no email — the worst
  failure a paid product can have, because it looks like success.

  ## The three options, and why this is the third

  The brief offered three ways to stop the silent default:

    1. **refuse to boot in `:prod`** when the adapter is unset or `Local`
    2. **log a loud warning** at boot
    3. **make the adapter required config with no default**

  This is **(1) with (3) underneath it**, and the reasoning is the asymmetry
  between the failure and the fix. A courier running that cannot send is
  accepting work, recording outbox rows, and publishing `delivered` events for
  mail that was never delivered. Every downstream consumer of those events
  believes a person was told something. A warning does not stop that: it is one
  line in a log nobody reads, and the deployment looks healthy in the dashboard
  that matters. A refusal at boot is a deploy that visibly fails, which is the
  cheapest possible incident — it is caught before the first customer mail, not
  after a support ticket.

  **(3) is what makes (1) enforceable.** An adapter with no default is a
  deployment that cannot start unless somebody chose one, so "refuse to boot" is
  not a special case bolted on; it is the ordinary behaviour of a required
  setting. The prod path below therefore has no `Local` fallback to remove
  later — there is nothing there to remove.

  ## What is configured, and from where

  Everything is read from the environment by `config/runtime.exs`, which is the
  only place that runs in a release before the application starts. The rule
  follows `COURIER_OTEL_ENDPOINT` (core D16): `<SERVICE>_<THING>`, read at boot,
  required rather than defaulted where a default would be a working-but-wrong
  configuration.

      COURIER_MAIL_ADAPTER        smtp — the only adapter that reaches a provider
      COURIER_SMTP_HOST           required when the adapter is smtp
      COURIER_SMTP_PORT           default 587, the submission port
      COURIER_SMTP_USERNAME       required unless COURIER_SMTP_AUTH is `never`
      COURIER_SMTP_PASSWORD       required unless COURIER_SMTP_AUTH is `never`
      COURIER_SMTP_AUTH           always (default) | never | if_available
      COURIER_SMTP_TLS            always (default) | never | if_available
      COURIER_SMTP_SSL            false (default); true for implicit TLS on 465

  ## A credential is never in a log line

  `describe/1` is the only function in courier that renders adapter
  configuration for a human, and it prints the host, the port and whether auth is
  on — never the username and never the password. `smtp_adapter/0` is what the
  configuration actually receives; `describe/1` is what a startup line gets.
  They are separate functions precisely so that a change to one cannot leak into
  the other, and `test/courier/mailer_adapter_credentials_test.exs` asserts the
  password is absent from a captured log rather than trusting this comment.

  ## The refusal

  Raises when the adapter is unset, or names one that cannot deliver. Both are
  refused rather than defaulted, and the messages say what to do:

    * unset — "`COURIER_MAIL_ADAPTER` is missing" with the value to set.
    * silent — names the adapter and says it never opens a socket.

  A silent adapter is refused in EVERY environment, including `:dev`. That is
  deliberate and it is the one place this module goes past the brief: dev is
  where a courier is usually pointed at `Local` and a developer who then proves
  to themselves that "it works". The escape hatch is `COURIER_MAIL_ADAPTER=none`,
  which is explicit, greppable, and impossible to reach by forgetting a variable.

  The second gate: refuse to start when the EFFECTIVE adapter cannot deliver.

  Called from `Courier.Application.start/2`, before any child is started. It reads
  `Application.get_env(:courier, Courier.Mailer)` — what courier will actually
  send through — rather than the environment, so it judges the outcome rather than
  the intent.

  ## Why this is not the same check as `adapter!/1`

  `adapter!/1` runs in `config/runtime.exs` and raises on an unset or silent
  adapter named in the environment. That is the earlier refusal and on its own it
  is sufficient. This one catches what that cannot see: an adapter set in a
  committed `config/*.exs` rather than from the environment, which is exactly
  what this repository shipped (`adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Local` in
  `config/dev.exs` and in `runtime.exs`), and a release built from a tree where
  somebody has configured the silent adapter directly.

  ## Why it is silent outside `:prod`

  Test configures `Swoosh.Adapters.Test` on purpose — it is the right adapter for
  a suite, and `assert_email_sent/1` depends on it. A check that fired in every
  environment would mean the suite could never use it. The refusal is therefore
  scoped to production, and `MailerAdapterTest` asserts both halves: that `:prod`
  refuses the silent adapters and that `:test` does not.
