defmodule Courier.WebhookEndpoints do
  @moduledoc """
  The context over `webhook_endpoints`: registering an endpoint, changing it,
  removing it, and the two states the delivery pipeline asks about.

  ## The URL is checked here, not in the changeset

  `create/1` and `update/2` run `Courier.Webhooks.UrlGuard` before touching the
  database. That ordering is the whole security property: an SSRF target is
  refused at the moment an account tries to register it, so the row that exists
  is a row courier is willing to sign for. A design that stored the URL and
  checked it at send time would leave a table full of `169.254.169.254` for
  whatever found it first.

  The guard needs a resolver, so it is configuration rather than a hard-coded
  call — `config :courier, :dns_resolver`. That is also what makes the SSRF tests
  possible without a network.

  ## The secret

  Generated on create, returned once, sealed at rest. `create/1` answers
  `{:ok, endpoint, secret}` — the plaintext is handed back here and nowhere else,
  because the API returns it exactly once and after that it exists only as
  ciphertext. A customer who loses it rotates the endpoint; courier does not keep
  a copy it could mail out again.

  customer pastes into their verifier. It is returned once, here, and never

  be a credential endpoint.

  Errors are two kinds and the difference matters to the caller. A
  `{:error, changeset}` is a typo — a missing field, a relative url, a duplicate.
  A `{:error, reason}` from the guard is a *refusal*: the url is a well-formed
  url courier will not send to, and the reason says which class it was, so the
  API can tell the customer their host resolves to a private address rather than
  that they typed it wrong.
