defmodule Courier.Suppression do
  @moduledoc """
  One provider's report about one address, and the state courier took from it.

  A row is **immutable**. Nothing in courier updates one, which is the whole
  reason the packet's precedence rule cannot be got wrong: `Courier.Suppressions`
  derives an address's state by folding over the rows that exist rather than by
  mutating one to a stronger value, so "a complaint is never downgraded by a later
  bounce" is not a rule somebody has to remember in a `case` — it is a property of
  there being nothing to update. See that module's moduledoc.

  `state` is courier's own vocabulary and not the provider's: a Postmark
  `HardBounce` and an SES `Permanent` are both `:undeliverable` here, because the
  question courier asks is not "what did Postmark call it" but "can this mailbox
  receive mail". `reason` keeps the provider's own words, bounded, because when an
  operator asks courier why an address is suppressed the useful answer is the
  provider's sentence and not courier's enum.

  ## `state` may be absent, and that is not a third value

  The column is `NOT NULL` in the database for every row a **provider** produces,
  and `create_email_suppressions` argues for it at length: "a hard bounce marks the
  address `undeliverable`, a complaint marks it `suppressed`, and there is no third
  'suppressed: true' boolean that cannot say which." All of that still holds — this
  is still an `Ecto.Enum` of two values, resolved in a changeset, with no database
  CHECK and no third value.

  What a later migration added is the possibility of **no** state, which is a
  different statement from a third one: it says the row is not a fact about the
  mailbox at all. Only `unsubscribe_changeset/2` can write one, and it never casts
  `state`, so "a row with no state" and "a row written by the unsubscribe
  endpoint" are the same row. `Courier.Suppressions.state/1` has folded that case
  to `nil` since before the column was nullable, and `suppressed?/1` and `find/1`
  filter on it already.

  ## The two columns a provider does not fill in

  `notification_type` and `user_id` are both nullable and both are set **only** by
  an unsubscribe, which is a report about an address that courier wrote itself
  rather than one a provider sent:

    * **`notification_type` is what makes a row an instruction rather than a
      fact.** RFC 8058's one-click unsubscribe stops ONE kind of mail. A bounce
      and a complaint carry a `state` and stop all of it, because they are facts
      about the mailbox; an unsubscribe carries **no state at all** — `nil` is the
      whole mechanism — and is read back by
      `Courier.Suppressions.unsubscribed?/2` against this column. `Courier.
      Unsubscribes` is where that argument is made in full; the migration's
      comment is where the consequence is, which is that a *stateful* unsubscribe
      row would mean a person who stops receiving product updates can no longer
      reset their password.
    * **`user_id` is the attribution a provider cannot give.** A bounce report
      names an address and nobody upstream knows which person it belongs to; a row
      that guessed would put a stranger's uuid on a fact about a mailbox. An
      unsubscribe is different — courier minted the token when it sent the message,
      so it knows, and core's `courier.notification.suppressed` schema requires the
      user as the envelope's subject. It is here so the row is interpretable on its
      own rather than only by joining to a token.

  ## What is deliberately absent

  There is no column for the provider's payload. A bounce report carries
  addresses, reasons, and sometimes a message snippet, and the four facts courier
  acts on are the four it stores. A schema that had a `payload` map would be a
  copy of somebody's inbox held for no operational reason, and
  `Courier.SuppressionsTest` asserts the field list so adding one is a decision
  somebody reads. The two above are the exceptions, and each is a fact courier
  knows rather than a fact somebody reported.

  The changeset for one provider report.

  Every field is courier's or the provider's verbatim. Nothing here is
  caller-settable in a way that bypasses the vocabulary: `state` is
  `Ecto.Enum`, so a value outside `@states` is a cast error rather than a row that
  reads as something courier decided.

  `email` is normalised on the way in, and the address format is checked at the
  boundary rather than trusted — an event with an unparseable address is not an
  event courier can act on, and storing it would create a row that
  `suppressed?/1` could never match.

  `message_id` loses RFC 5322's angle brackets for the same reason `email` is
  downcased: providers quote the same identifier in more than one spelling, and two
  spellings must not be two rows.

  The changeset for a **one-click unsubscribe** (RFC 8058), which is the same
  table written by courier rather than by a provider.

  **The difference from `changeset/2` is one line that is not there**: `state` is
  neither cast nor required. Everything else — the normalisation of the address,
  the format check, the three length bounds, the unique index on
  `(provider, provider_event_id)` — is the same function for the same reasons, and
  the two changesets are kept apart rather than merged behind a flag because a
  `state`-carrying row and a `state`-less one are different facts about a mailbox
  and a caller that could ask for either by passing an option would eventually ask
  for the wrong one.

  Why a state-less row is the whole mechanism rather than a detail: a bounce and a
  complaint are facts about the mailbox and refuse every notification type courier
  sends, and an unsubscribe is an instruction about ONE type. `Courier.Deliver`
  consults this table for a password reset as firmly as it does for a newsletter,
  so a `:suppressed` state here would be a person who stops receiving product
  updates and then cannot reset their password. A `nil` state is invisible to the
  fold in `Courier.Suppressions.state/1` — the same way a soft bounce records
  nothing — and visible to `Courier.Suppressions.unsubscribed?/2`.

  `user_id` is put rather than cast, for the reason `changeset/2` puts
  `email`: the value comes from the token courier minted, and nothing about a
  request should be able to choose whose answer this is.
