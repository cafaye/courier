defmodule Courier.Idempotency do
  @moduledoc """
  The context over `idempotency_keys`: claiming a key, and either storing the
  answer or giving it back.

  Core's `docs/openapi-conventions.md` §Idempotency is the specification. This
  module implements the storage half of it; `CourierWeb.Plugs.Idempotency` is the
  half that reads a header and answers a request, and the two are split so the
  arithmetic can be tested without a plug pipeline and the wiring can be tested
  without a database.

  ## Why the claim is written before the work

  A key that is only recorded *after* the action cannot prevent anything. Two
  requests with one key would both run, both mutate, and both try to store — and
  the second store would either overwrite the first or be rejected, after the
  damage. So `claim/1` is called before the controller and `complete/4` after it,
  and the row exists in between in the `in_flight` state, which is what a second
  request with the same key finds.

  ## Why the unique index is read, and not `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`

  The first draft of this module used `on_conflict: :nothing` and looked for a
  returned row with a nil `id`, which is how Ecto reports "nothing was inserted".
  That does not work against a schema whose primary key is
  `@primary_key {:id, Ecto.UUID, autogenerate: true}`, and it fails silently:

  **the id is generated into the changeset before the query runs**, so on a real
  conflict Ecto hands back a struct carrying a fresh, well-formed uuid that was
  never inserted — and `__meta__.state` on that struct is `:loaded` too. Measured
  rather than assumed: two inserts of one triple, the second conflicting, return
  two different ids and leave one row, so nothing on the struct can answer "did
  this insert?".

  So the claim takes the constraint error, and `refusal/1` matches it on the index
  **by name**. The unique index is what makes the claim at the database rather
  than in a check a caller might forget, and it is the same index either way —
  this is only about how the losing insert finds out that it lost.

  ## Expiry is enforced on the way in, not by a job

  core says 24 hours. Nothing sweeps the table on a timer — a second supervision
  tree for a table this size is a service that can be down — so `claim/1` deletes
  the expired rows for the triple it is about to claim, immediately before the
  insert. A key the caller has not used for a day behaves as though it had never
  been used, which is what "retention: 24 hours" means, and the sweep only ever
  runs on a key somebody is actually presenting.

  ## What is stored, and what is not

  Only a 2xx is stored, and `release/1` deletes the claim for anything else. The
  reason is that a stored 4xx pins a *caller's* mistake for a day — a client that
  sent a bad url, fixed it and retried with the same key would get 409
  `idempotency_key_reused` rather than its new answer — and a stored 5xx pins a
  *courier's* transient failure for a day, which turns a blip into an outage
  nobody can retry their way out of. A retry of a failed request re-running it is
  always safe, because nothing was committed. Only a successful mutation is worth
  replaying, so only a successful mutation is replayed.
