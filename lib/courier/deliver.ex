defmodule Courier.Deliver do
  @moduledoc """
  Where courier's three promises meet: the user's preference wins, the
  provider's answer is recorded, and the event describing the send is written in
  the same transaction as the send.

      iex> welcome(%{user_id: user_id, email: email, name: name, url: url})
      {:ok, %{notification_type: "welcome", message_id: message_id, event_id: event_id}}

  The order of the checks is the contract:

    1. **The type is one courier sends.** `:unknown_notification_type` — courier
       does not guess what a caller meant.
    2. **The payload names a user.** `:missing_user_id` — there are no
       preferences to check without one, and no user to attribute the send to.
    3. **The payload can be rendered.** `{:error, {:invalid_payload, changeset}}`
       — refused *before* the provider is asked, because a provider that accepts
       a mail courier cannot build has now sent something to a person.
    4. **The user wants it.** `:suppressed` — no mail, no event, no record of a
       send that did not happen.
    5. **They have unsubscribed from this type.** `{:error, {:unsubscribed, type}}`
       — the recipient pressed the one-click unsubscribe button in a previous
       message (RFC 8058) and courier recorded it. **Per type, not per address**,
       which is the whole reason it is a question of its own.
    6. **The mailbox can receive it.** `{:error, {:suppressed_address, state}}` —
       a hard bounce (RFC 5321 §5.1.1, `:undeliverable`) or a spam complaint
       (RFC 2142 §5, `:suppressed`) recorded by a provider. Also before the
       provider is asked, and also no mail, no event, no record.
    7. **The message has something in it.** `{:error, :empty_message}` — a
       rendered message with neither a text nor an HTML body. `Swoosh` would
       accept it and answer a provider-shaped id, so this is the last check before
       the transaction rather than an afterthought inside it.

  Steps 4, 5 and 6 are three different questions and the order is deliberate: "does
  this person want this mail?" is asked before "can this mailbox still receive
  it?", because the user's own answer is the one they can act on. Steps 5 and 6
  are both about the address and are **not** the same question — 5 is about one
  notification type and 6 is about the mailbox itself, so a person who
  unsubscribed from product updates still gets their password reset. All three
  stop the send: mailing a dead address costs a sending domain its reputation, and
  mailing somebody who unsubscribed or marked you as spam costs more.

  What is left is one transaction: the provider is called and the outbox row is
  written. If the provider refuses, the transaction rolls back and there is
  nothing claiming a mail went out; if it accepts, the row is there to be
  published and the caller gets the message id and the event's id.

  ## The one-click unsubscribe, and why it is inside that transaction

  A bulk message carries `List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post` (RFC 8058
  §3.1) pointing at a token courier mints for that message, and the token is a
  **row** — so it is written in the same transaction as the send, for the same
  reason the outbox row is. A send that rolled back must not leave a live
  unsubscribe credential behind for a message nobody received.

  Which messages carry the headers is not decided here: `Courier.Unsubscribes.
  decorate_for/3` asks `Courier.Mailers.kind/1`, and all three of courier's types
  are `:transactional`, so today every message comes back untouched and no token
  is minted. `Courier.Unsubscribes` is where that is argued.

  Nothing here touches NATS. The relay that publishes is
  `Courier.Workers.ProcessOutboxWorker`.

  # want mail at would be a strange remedy to offer.

  # whole reason a one-click unsubscribe is a state-less `email_suppressions` row

  # sender-reputation problem — and a boolean would have thrown that away.
  #
  # `state/1` costs one `EXISTS` per state it tests, up to two, on the path every

  # transaction open across a network call; that is the outbox's price, not a
  # mistake, and a send is one HTTP request.
  #
  # **The one-click unsubscribe token is minted in here too, and for the same
  # reason.** It is a row that exists because of this send, so a send that rolled
  # back must not leave one behind: a token nobody was ever offered is a live
  # credential for an unsubscribe, for an address about to be sent mail by somebody
  # else. `Courier.Unsubscribes.decorate_for/3` is one call and it decides the
  # whole thing — a transactional type comes back untouched with no row, a bulk one
  # comes back with the two RFC 8058 headers and a token — so the conditional does
  # not live in this module and cannot drift from the kind table.
