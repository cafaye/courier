defmodule Courier.Mailers do
  @moduledoc """
  courier composes mail. It does not send it (`Courier.Mailer` does), store it,
  or model users — the payload arrives already keyed the way the platform keys
  its events, and courier renders it.

      iex> build(:welcome, %{user_id: id, email: "kaka@example.com", name: "Kaka", url: url})
      {:ok, %Swoosh.Email{}}

  `build/2` returns the message rather than sending it, which is the seam that
  keeps Swoosh out of the assertions: a built email can be read field by field,
  with no adapter, no mailbox, and no network. `deliver/2` is `build/2` plus
  `Courier.Mailer.deliver/1`.

  ## The three types

  `welcome`, `password_reset`, and `team_invitation` are courier's whole
  catalog — the same three the platform triggers. Each has its own required
  fields, and each says so:

  | type             | required                                |
  | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | `welcome`        | `email`                                 |
  | `password_reset` | `email`, `url`                          |
  | `team_invitation`| `email`, `url`, `account_name`, `invited_by` |

  A payload courier cannot send is `{:error, {:invalid_payload, changeset}}`
  rather than a mail with a hole in it: a reset mail with no link, or an
  invitation with nobody to attribute it to, is noise in a person's inbox.

  ## Configuration

  The sender and the subject lines are configuration
  (`config :courier, :mailing`, with the address overridden from the
  environment in `config/runtime.exs`), because they are the two things an
  operator should be able to reword without touching a module. Subjects are
  templates with `%{key}` placeholders filled from the payload.

  Both are reported as their own errors rather than as a malformed mail: a
  subject template naming a key the payload does not carry
  (`:subject_misconfigured`) or an unconfigured sender
  (`:from_not_configured`) is a deployment that is wrong, not a request that is
  wrong, and the two must not be confused in an operator's logs.

  ## Templates

  Bodies are `EEx` templates under `lib/courier/mailers/templates/`, compiled at
  build time by `Courier.Mailers.Templates` and wrapped in one shared layout per
  format, so every email courier sends is wrapped alike. They are not HEEx: this
  repository's dependency list has no HEEx engine (`phoenix_template` 1.1 with no
  LiveView, no `phoenix_component`), and AGENTS.md's rule is that a dependency is
  not added "just to prepare". The trade is explicit rather than hidden: the one
  free-text field per message, the recipient's `name`, is escaped where it enters
  the template assigns (`Plug.HTML.html_escape/1`), because plain EEx
  interpolates what it is given.

  Whether a built message carries a body in at least one format.

  The one thing about a rendered message that the renderer itself cannot be
  trusted to get right, and it is checked here rather than at a caller because
  the message is only in hand here.

  Every template courier renders today produces both a text and an HTML body, so
  this is green by construction and exists for the case where it would not be: a
  template that renders empty, a layout that swallows its body, a format added
  later without one. `Swoosh` accepts an email with no body at all and hands back a
  provider-shaped id for it, so a bodiless message that reached a provider would
  be reported as sent, written to the outbox, and published as
  `courier.email.delivered` — the silent-default failure the whole adapter work
  exists to end, reached by a different road.

  Empty strings are **not** bodies. `""` renders to a mail a person opens and finds
  blank, which is the same defect as no body with one more step of indirection.

  Public and tested on hand-built messages because a predicate that only ever sees
  messages it is guaranteed to accept is a predicate nothing has checked.
