defmodule Courier.WebhookDelivery do
  @moduledoc """
  One delivery of one event to one endpoint, and the retry state that goes with
  it.

  One row per `(endpoint_id, event_id)`, not one per attempt. That is the choice
  the rest of the module follows from:

    * **`webhook_id` is generated once, here, and never changes.** The spec
      §Webhook metadata requires that "the unique identifier ... remains the same
      no matter how many times a webhook that has failed is retried", because
      consumers deduplicate on it (PLAN.md §3: delivery is at-least-once, so
      every consumer is idempotent). A row per attempt would need the id to be
      derivable from something other than the row, and a row per *delivery* makes
      "the same id" true by construction — there is only ever one id.
    * **`attempt` counts up, and `next_attempt_at` says when the next one is
      due.** The retry budget is a property of the delivery, so it lives on the
      delivery, and "what is due now" is one query against a partial index.

  `status` is four values, not two. `failed` means "this will be tried again";
  `exhausted` means "the budget is spent and it will not be", and the difference
  is the difference between a consumer that is down and a consumer that is gone.
