  @moduledoc """
  One account's subscription to courier's events at one URL.

  ## The secret

  `secret` holds the sealing ciphertext, never the secret: `Courier.SecretBox`
  seals it on the way in and opens it on the way out, and no other module is
  allowed to read the column. The plaintext exists in exactly two places — the
  single `201` response that hands it to the customer, and the process that signs
  a delivery with it.

  The secret is generated rather than supplied, and is not a castable field. A
  body that names its own `secret` is ignored, for the same reason
  `NotificationPreference` does not cast `user_id`: a field the caller controls
  that names a credential is a field the caller owns.

  ## The status column and why it is not just a boolean

  Two values, `enabled` and `disabled`, and `Courier.WebhookEndpoints` keeps them
  apart in `disabled_reason`. A customer disabling their own endpoint and courier
  tripping its circuit breaker are the same column and different worlds: the
  first is a decision the customer made and courier must not undo, the second is
  courier protecting them from an endpoint that has been failing, and which
  should clear itself the moment a delivery succeeds.

  The changeset for a new endpoint.

  The shape is checked, not the destination: `Courier.Webhooks.UrlGuard` is the
  module that decides whether courier will send anything to a URL, and it needs a
  resolver to do it. A changeset cannot hold a resolver, so it enforces what it
  can — an absolute http(s) URL with a host — and the context runs the guard
  before this is ever called. A URL that passes this and fails the guard is a
  422 naming the real reason; a URL that fails this is a 422 naming a typo.
