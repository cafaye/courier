defmodule Courier.ErrorRelay.Sink.Req do
  @moduledoc """
  The shipped sink: a Sentry envelope POSTed to a GlitchTip instance.

  ## The DSN is parsed once, at boot, and the key never appears in a log line

  A DSN is `scheme://public_key:secret_key@host:port/project_id`. GlitchTip's
  envelope endpoint is `POST /api/{project_id}/envelope/` and it authenticates
  with `X-Sentry-Auth: Sentry sentry_version=7, sentry_client=…,
  sentry_key={public_key}`.

  So a DSN is a credential and this module treats it as one: it is parsed in
  `init/1`, the components are kept in the sink's options, and every refusal
  below reports a **symbol** rather than the URL it came from. A relay that logs
  its own DSN puts a GlitchTip write key in a log store, which is the exact leak
  this packet is about — committed by the thing built to prevent it.

  ## Nothing here buffers and nothing here retries

  `receive_timeout` is set, and there is exactly one attempt. The same rule the
  collector's exporters follow with `sending_queue: {enabled: false}` and
  `retry_on_failure: {enabled: false}`, for the same reason: a queue is a memory
  leak with a telemetry-shaped trigger, and a retry loop against a dead store is
  a thread waking on a timer for the life of the process, invisible in every
  dashboard because nothing is being recorded. **A lost error is strictly better
  than a growing process.** The store is at-least-once from the reporter's point
  of view only because the reporter retries, and a reporter that has given up
  has bigger problems than one missing crash.

  A 4xx is counted the same as a 5xx, and logged at the same level, on purpose:
  the store rejecting a malformed envelope is a bug in the relay, and the relay
  is going to find out from the counter rather than from a log line somebody
  reads once.

  Turn a DSN into the URL and headers the store wants.

  `{:ok, url, headers}` or `{:error, reason}`. The reasons are symbols for the
  reason in the moduledoc: a DSN is a credential, and a parse failure that
  included the string being parsed would put half a write key in a log.

  `http` is accepted and `https` is **not required**, because a self-hoster
  running GlitchTip on the compose network reaches it over plain HTTP and
  refusing that would make the supported deployment the unsupported one. What
  this does *not* do is follow a redirect: `Req` defaults to not following them,
  and a redirect from an error-ingestion endpoint is a way to make the relay
  POST an envelope somewhere else, so the option is stated rather than left to a
  default that could change.
