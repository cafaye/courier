defmodule Courier.ErrorRelay.Policy do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  The redaction boundary for the error path, as an allowlist over a Sentry event.

  ## Why this module exists at all, given the collector already redacts

  It does not already redact **this**. PLAN.md §7b and
  `core/schemas/telemetry/redaction.schema.json` put the redaction boundary at
  one chokepoint — the OTel collector — and that chokepoint is real and enforced
  for traces, metrics and logs. A Sentry envelope is a **fourth signal** and the
  collector cannot reach it: GlitchTip speaks the Sentry envelope protocol and
  has no OTLP receiver for errors, so there is no point in the pipeline where an
  error could be handed to the `redaction` processor. That is the caveat the
  packet is honest about, and it is why this module exists rather than a
  sentence in a README.

  So the architecture is: **the SDK sends to the relay, and the relay is the
  chokepoint.** One implementation of the policy, in one place, in one language,
  that every service's error path passes through — which is the same property
  the collector has for the other three signals, obtained the only way it could
  be here.

  ## The consequence, stated where nobody can miss it

  This policy removes the **exception message** and the **frame variables** from
  every event. That is deliberate and it is the price of admission.

  An error store is a retained, indexed, widely-readable store that a human
  reads on purpose — which is exactly the threat model core's redaction policy
  was written for. The collector already deletes `exception.message` and
  `exception.stacktrace` off span events for the same reason; its own comment
  calls `exception.message` "a path straight to a prompt", and notes that "a
  content-policy rejection quotes the offending content back at you". In Go and
  Ruby the frame variables are the **arguments**, and in Elixir an exception
  raised with a token in its message carries that token in `type` as often as
  in `value`.

  What a stored error therefore has is: the exception's class, the file, the
  line, the function, whether the frame is application code, the release, the
  environment, the HTTP method, the route template, the runtime, and the
  `error.type` class from core's closed vocabulary. That is enough to act on a
  crash — it names the bug and the line — and none of it is something a customer
  typed. What it does not have is the message, which is the sentence a human
  most wants. **That is the trade, and it is a trade, not an oversight.**

  A team that needs the message needs a decision to make deliberately, and the
  decision is not this module's to make quietly.

  ## Default-deny, and why that is the load-bearing word

  Every map is rebuilt from an allowlist. A key that is not named below is not
  "sanitised" — it never existed as far as the forwarded event is concerned.
  A denylist of bad key names has to enumerate everything that can leak, and the
  realistic leak is a name nobody predicted: a Sentry `context` a service
  invented last week, an `extra` key added by a library, a `request` field a new
  SDK version started sending. Default-allow would make the safe case the thing
  you have to remember, and the safe case is the one nobody is thinking about
  when they are debugging something at 3am.

  ## `blocked_values` is the second barrier, and it is a different KIND of one

  The allowlist keeps a *key* out. It cannot keep a credential out of a key the
  allowlist *keeps* — `transaction` is allowlisted, and a caller who
  interpolates a tenant id into it has put an unbounded string in a bounded
  field. So every surviving string is also passed through the collector's own
  three credential shapes and masked.

  Two independent controls, because the realistic way this leaks is one of them
  being removed by a well-meaning change and nobody noticing for a month. The
  vocabulary below is **byte-identical** to `blocked_values` in kit's
  `redaction/cafaye_traces` processor. Two lists that can drift are one list too
  many, so this is the collector's list and a change to one is a change to both.

  ## `error.type` is the closed vocabulary, which is what keeps this reversible

  core's `error.type` is an `enum` of twelve classes plus the OTel fallback
  `_OTHER`, identical on traces, metrics and logs. An event whose
  `error.type` is outside it is **replaced with `_OTHER`, not passed through** —
  core-04 constrained the value with a `pattern` and got `user_42_email_invalid`
  validating cleanly, which is a value per user on the dimension a dashboard
  groups by.

  An event with **no** class at all is refused outright, by `classify/1` and not
  here. Defaulting it would put `_OTHER` in the store and make an alert on
  `_OTHER` — which is an alert that *this service has not classified its own
  errors* — silently unreachable.

  This is the whole reason the packet standardises on the OTel conventions
  rather than on Sentry's own grouping. Because the same attribute name, with
  the same closed vocabulary, is what the trace signal already carries, the error
  store is joinable to the trace signal and a future move to a different backend
  is a change of DSN rather than a rewrite of every call site.

  ## Handled and retried errors are not recorded

  The OTel spec is explicit — "Errors that were retried or handled (allowing an
  operation to complete gracefully) SHOULD NOT be recorded on spans or metrics
  that describe this operation" — and this policy cannot enforce it, because by
  the time an event reaches it the decision has been made upstream. It is
  enforced where the decision is made, in `Courier.ErrorReporting.capture/3` and
  its two siblings in the other two services: only a failure that reached the
  top of the stack is captured, and a rescued-and-retried one never is.
