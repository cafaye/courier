defmodule Courier.Mailers.Templates do
  @moduledoc """
  The mail bodies, compiled when courier is compiled.

  Compiling them here rather than reading them at runtime is what makes a
  release image work: `EEx.eval_file/3` would need the `.eex` files on disk, and
  Mix copies `lib/` into the beam, not loose templates beside it. It also means a
  template that does not parse fails `mix compile` rather than the first welcome
  mail somebody is waiting for.

  The `@external_resource` attributes are what make that true on a *rebuild*:
  without them Mix would not recompile this module when a template changed, and
  a fixed template would keep shipping the old body.

  the assigns bound under the name the template refers to.
