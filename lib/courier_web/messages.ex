defmodule CourierWeb.Messages do
  @moduledoc """
  The HTTP send surface's own rules: what a `POST /v1/messages` body must carry,
  what it becomes, and the one invariant about the message courier renders from
  it.

  This is courier's send path reached over HTTP, and the vocabulary is
  deliberately **closed**. `Courier.Mailers` casts a payload with
  `Ecto.Changeset.cast/3` against a fixed field list and discards everything else
  without a word — which is the right behaviour for a library a trusted caller
  holds, and the wrong behaviour for a request body, where a misspelled
  `emai_enabled` or an `account_id` that courier reads nowhere would otherwise be
  accepted with no sign that anything was ignored. So every key is checked against
  the list below, and an unknown one is a 422.

  ## Why the sender is not a request field

  The brief for this surface asked for a `from`, and there is not one. courier's
  sender is `config :courier, :mailing[:from]` and the subjects beside it, because
  the sender is the one field a caller must not be able to choose: an authenticated
  tenant that could set `From:` would be a phishing relay wearing the platform's
  sending domain, and the reputation cost of that lands on every other tenant's
  mail. `Courier.Mailers.from/0` already refuses an unconfigured sender as
  `:from_not_configured` and this surface inherits that refusal rather than adding
  a second one.

  A body carrying `from` is therefore an unknown field and a 422 naming `from` —
  the same answer `emai_enabled` gets, and a stronger one than `user_id` gets,
  because `user_id` really is a field and this request's own `type` overwrites
  what a payload would have carried.

  ## Why the bodies are templates rather than request fields

  The same argument one layer in. courier sends *transactional* mail that it
  renders from `lib/courier/mailers/templates/`, and a raw `text`/`html` pair on
  the wire would make courier a general-purpose relay: every template, every
  layout, every escaping decision, handed to whichever authenticated caller asked.
  The "at least one body" rule therefore survives as a check on the **rendered**
  message rather than on the request — `Courier.Mailers.body?/1`, called from
  `Courier.Deliver` where the message is the only thing in hand.

  ## `to` is `email`, and the mapping is here rather than in the controller

  `Courier.Mailers` has always keyed the recipient as `email`, because that is
  what the platform's event payloads carry. Over HTTP the same field reads as
  `to`, which is the mail vocabulary and the one a caller writing an HTTP client
  expects. One mapping, in one place, so the two spellings cannot drift into
  meaning different things.

  Checks `params` against the vocabulary and returns the payload for
  `Courier.Deliver` when it passes.

  `{:ok, payload}`, or `{:error, fields}` where `fields` is the list of
  `%{"field" => name, "code" => code}` entries a 422 renders as `errors[]`.

  **Every** failing field is reported rather than the first. A caller who can fix
  a body in one round trip is a caller who will; a caller who has to guess which
  of five fields was wrong will fix the wrong one.

  ## What is checked here, and what is deliberately not

  Only the three things a cast through `Courier.Mailers` cannot catch:

    * **unknown keys** — it discards them silently, which over HTTP is how a
      misspelling becomes a setting the caller believes took effect;
    * **a missing or blank `type`** — the context answers
      `:unknown_notification_type`, and naming the field is what makes the 422
      actionable rather than a shrug;
    * **a `user_id` that is not a uuid** — `notification_preferences` is keyed by
      it and the emitted event attributes the send to it, so a non-uuid is a
      preference courier cannot read and a consumer that cannot correlate.

  The per-type required fields, the address's format and the subject placeholders
  are `Courier.Mailers`' own validation, and they arrive as
  `{:error, {:invalid_payload, changeset}}` for the controller to render from the
  changeset's own errors. Two validators that both listed required fields would be
  two lists of required fields, and one of them would be the stale one.
