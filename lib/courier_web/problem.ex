defmodule CourierWeb.Problem do
  @moduledoc """
  The error envelope, which is core's and not courier's
  (`core/docs/openapi-conventions.md`, RFC 9457). No service invents its own
  error body, so this module is the one place courier builds one and there is no
  second shape to drift into.

      %{
        "type" => "https://errors.cafaye.com/validation_failed",
        "title" => "Validation failed",
        "status" => 422,
        "detail" => "...",
        "instance" => "/v1/notification_preferences/6f5d...",
        "code" => "validation_failed",
        "trace_id" => "...",
        "errors" => [%{"field" => "preferences[0].notification_type", "code" => "invalid_format"}]
      }

  `type` is the machine-readable contract and `code` is its last segment;
  `title` is a fixed summary for the code and `detail` is specific to this
  occurrence and is not parsed by clients. `trace_id` is always present and
  always matches the `X-Trace-Id` response header, which
  `CourierWeb.Plugs.Trace` sets before the router runs — so it is there for a
  request that matched no route, which is exactly the request support asks
  about.

  `errors` is the per-field list, and it appears only when there is one. The
  `field` is the path in the *request* (`preferences[0].notification_type`), not
  the changeset key: the caller sent a body, and the body is what they can fix.

  ## Codes

  Core's reserved list, plus `bad_request` and `not_acceptable`. Core names the
  reserved list for the statuses it enumerates and says 400 is for malformed
  syntax the client could not have known; it does not name a slug for it, and a
  body that is not JSON at all still needs a stable `code` for the same reason
  every other code is stable. The same is true of 406, which Phoenix's `:accepts`
  plug raises on every request whose `Accept` excludes `json`, and which core
  does not enumerate.

  `not_acceptable` is here because 406 used to fall through to the `:internal`
  default. A client that asked for `text/html` and was answered
  `{"status": 406, "code": "internal", "title": "Internal server error"}` had its
  own `Accept` header reported back to it as courier failing. Core reserves
  `internal` for 500, so a 406 wearing that slug is a lie in the
  machine-readable contract — and it is the kind of lie a generated client turns
  into a retry loop, because "internal" is the one code every client retries.

  **Two of the codes share 409, and core's own reserved list does the same**:
  `conflict` and `idempotency_key_reused` are both listed at 409, and
  `CourierWeb.Plugs.Idempotency` sends each for a different reason. A client
  branches on `code` and not on the status, so the two are distinguishable; the
  consequence to be aware of is only that `for_status/1` cannot recover which of
  them a bare 409 meant, and it is never asked — nothing in Phoenix raises a 409,
  so that function is only ever the fallback for a status that arrived from
  outside a controller.

  Everything else still falls back to `internal`, so an unlisted status answers
  with courier's envelope rather than Phoenix's. `for_status/1` is the seam, and
  every status courier can be made to return has a line in the table above it;
  `test/courier_web/openapi_error_responses_test.exs` is what keeps the two in
  step.
