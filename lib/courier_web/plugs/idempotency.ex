defmodule CourierWeb.Plugs.Idempotency do
  @moduledoc """
  Accepts `Idempotency-Key` on a mutating `POST` and makes a retry free.

  Core's `docs/openapi-conventions.md` §Idempotency is the specification, in
  five sentences, and this plug is where each one lives:

  | core | here |
  | ---- | ---- |
  | "`Idempotency-Key: <uuid>`, chosen by the client" | `present/1` — absent is normal, a non-uuid is a 422 |
  | "Scope: the `(endpoint, principal, key)` triple" | the claim is keyed on `conn.assigns.current_account` and `conn.request_path` |
  | "Retention: 24 hours, stored with the response" | `Courier.Idempotency.claim/1` |
  | "Replay with the same key **and** the same request body returns the original response and `Idempotency-Replayed: true`" | `replay/2` |
  | "Replay with the same key but a different body returns 409 `idempotency_key_reused`" | `reused/1` |
  | "Requests without the key are processed normally" | the first clause of `call/2` |

  ## The fourth case, which core does not describe

  Two requests with one key arriving **at the same time** is not a retry — the
  first has not answered yet, so there is no response to give back. core's five
  sentences do not reach it, and the choice here is deliberate:

  It is a **409 `conflict`**, not a replay and not a third code. It is not
  `idempotency_key_reused`, which would say the key was used twice with different
  bodies when in fact the bodies are identical. It is `conflict` because that is
  what it is: this request conflicts with the state of the resource, and core
  already reserves the code for 409. The `detail` says which case it is, so a
  client that hits it knows to retry the same key shortly rather than to change
  anything.

  ## The hash is over the decoded body

  `request_hash/1` hashes the **parsed** params, not the bytes on the wire. Two
  bodies that mean the same thing are therefore the same request, and a client
  that reformats its JSON between a call and its retry gets a replay rather than
  a conflict it did nothing to cause. The canonical form sorts map keys, because
  a hash that depended on the order a JSON parser happened to produce would make
  "the same body" mean something an implementation detail decides.

  The raw body is not available here and could not be: `CourierWeb.Plugs.ParseBody`
  is an **endpoint** plug, so it has already read and parsed the body by the time
  any router pipeline runs.

  ## Nothing here logs the key or the body

  A stored `response_body` on `POST /v1/webhook_endpoints` is the 201 carrying the
  `whsec_` signing secret. A log line carrying it would be a credential in a log,
  so the failure path below reports the row's own uuid and the status and nothing
  else. The key itself is client-chosen and not a secret, but it is not logged
  either — a store failure is diagnosable from a row id.
