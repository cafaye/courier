defmodule CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves who is calling, and refuses the request when nobody is.

  ## This is a seam with one implementation, and both directions are closed

  The seam was written when courier had no verifier, and what was settled then is
  still settled:

    * **A request with no principal is a 401, always.** courier never guesses an
      account for an anonymous caller, and it never falls back to a default one.
    * **The account comes from the principal, never from the body.** Every
      controller reads `conn.assigns.current_account` and the context is called
      with that; an `account_id` in a request body is ignored, and the tests say so
      on every action that would be affected.
    * **The account comes from the principal, and the principal's account comes
      from `account_id`.** `Courier.Principal.Introspection.Document` refuses an
      active document that carries no `account_id` and never reads `sub` as one.

  ## Three answers, and why the third is a 503 and not a 401

  `Courier.Principal.Resolver` answers one of three things:

      {:ok, principal}        the caller, on the account identity named
      :error                  nobody — an unauthenticated 401
      {:error, :unavailable}  courier could not find out

  The third case is new, and it is not a detail. identity is a network hop on the
  request path of every authenticated call, and it will be slow or down at some
  point. When it is:

    * **a 401 would be a lie with a cost.** It says "your credential is not
      acceptable". A customer holding a perfectly good token reads that, rotates
      it, and is still refused. So does an operator: a wall of "invalid
      credentials" when the fault is one environment variable.
    * **allowing the request would be worse.** It is the fail-open case, and it
      fails *silently* — which is what makes it worse than `Courier.Principal.
      Reject`. A locked door is at least visibly locked.
    * **so it is a 503 `unavailable`,** the same status courier already sends when
      the mail provider refuses, and the same rule: courier is fine, its dependency
      is not. It is a retryable status on a caller's side and a diagnosable state
      on courier's.

  The 401 this plug sends is **what it always was**, and that is a test rather
  than a promise: `test/courier_web/plugs/principal_config_test.exs` drives the
  same request through both resolvers and asserts the two envelopes are equal
  field for field — `type`, `code`, `status`, `title`, `detail`, `instance`. The
  one field it drops is `trace_id`, and it drops that one **by name** rather than
  by a rule, because that field is per request by design and comparing two
  requests' identities would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with this
  plug.

  ## The header the test resolver reads

  `x-courier-account` is `Courier.TestSupport.HeaderResolver`'s stand-in for the
  verified claim, and it is only ever read when `config :courier, :principal`
  points at that module. **`Courier.Principal.Introspection` ignores it
  entirely**, and that is asserted over a real resolver call rather than left as a
  convention — a header that becomes a fast path is an authentication bypass with
  a config file attached.

  ## Why the account and not a role

  Core's OpenAPI conventions are explicit: "`scopes` for capability, `account_id`
  for tenancy… Services do not parse roles out of a `roles` claim — they check
  `scopes`, or ask identity." courier therefore has no notion of owner / admin /
  member, and the authorization matrix is expressed in those two terms: is there a
  principal, is this their account, and is the action permitted on it. A future
  scope check is one more question in this plug, not a new authorization model —
  and see `Courier.Principal`'s moduledoc for why that check cannot be written
  yet.
