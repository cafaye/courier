  @moduledoc """
  One span per request, carrying the route TEMPLATE and the status.

  ## Why `register_before_send/2` and not a `[:telemetry]` handler

  Phoenix emits `[:phoenix, :router_dispatch, :start | :stop | :exception]`, and
  that is the obvious thing to instrument. It does not work, and the reason is
  measured rather than guessed — the metadata on those events is:

      EVENT: {[:phoenix, :router_dispatch, :start], [:system_time], nil, nil}
      EVENT: {[:phoenix, :router_dispatch, :stop],  [:duration],   nil, nil}

  `:route` is `nil` and there is no `:path`. So the `http.route` dimension the
  fleet's metrics are grouped by cannot be read from them, and a handler-based span
  would carry no route — which is the attribute the whole cardinality argument
  turns on.

  `register_before_send/2` is the supported way to run code after the rest of a
  pipeline, and by then the router has matched. The first version of this was a
  STRUCT plug using `handle_result/3`, which is Plug.Builder's other way to get an
  after-hook, and it did not work: Phoenix's `plug_builder_call/2` only treats a
  plug as a struct plug when the builder was compiled with that knowledge, and it
  was not, so the endpoint raised on the first request —

      expected CourierWeb.Plugs.Telemetry.call/2 to return a Plug.Conn, all plugs
      must receive a connection (conn) and return a connection, got:
      {:ok, %Plug.Conn{…}, %CourierWeb.Plugs.Telemetry{span: nil}}

  `register_before_send/2` needs no cooperation from the builder and also runs on a
  response written by an exception handler, which is the coverage that was wanted.

  ## What is recorded, and what is not

  Four attributes, all bounded, all on core's trace allowlist, all through
  `Courier.Observability.record/2` — the one path to a span:

    * `http.request.method` — here, outside the router, so a 404 and a 405 carry
      it too. Those never reach a pipeline, and a 404 whose span says nothing
      about what was asked for is a request an operator cannot search for.
    * `http.route` — here, after the router, from the matched pattern.
    * `http.response.status_code` — the status, on the way out.
    * `error.type` — on a 5xx, and on nothing else.

  NOT `url.path`, `url.query`, `user_agent.*`, `net.peer.*` or
  `http.request.header.*`. courier authenticates with a bearer token and sends
  mail on other services' behalf, so a header attribute is a credential in a
  searchable store and a query string is caller text by another name.

  ## The 404 carries no route, and that is a decision rather than a gap

  Putting the unmatched path in `http.route` is the obvious "fix" for a 404 whose
  span looks incomplete, and it is exactly wrong: the path is caller-controlled,
  so it is unbounded text in a metric label — one series per URL anybody ever
  tried, at the customer's expense. The status already says what happened.
  `test/courier/telemetry_canary_test.exs` asserts the absence, so it stays a
  decision rather than becoming an accident.

  ## Two ways out, and the second one is easy to forget

  The span is stashed in the process dictionary, and the `finish_request/1` hook
  takes it out. Phoenix dispatches a request on one process, so the dictionary is
  the right lifetime, and it is the same lifetime the SDK's own
  `set_current_span/1` uses. A raise never reaches `register_before_send`, so
  `on_router_exception/4` is attached as well; without it a panicking request
  leaks a span the SDK's sweeper then reaps and nobody ever sees.

  Continue the caller's trace, from an inbound `traceparent`.

  The COMPOSITE propagator does the parsing — `:trace_context` and `:baggage`, the
  same two `Courier.Telemetry.sdk_config/0` installs — and this is a carrier over
  the header list. A malformed header is IGNORED, never a 400: §3.2.2.3 says to
  ignore it, and correlation metadata is an observability affordance — an affordance
  that can take a customer's request down is a denial-of-service vector aimed at
  courier's own surface.

  The lookup is case-insensitive because `Plug.Conn.req_headers` carries the binary
  in whatever case the client sent, and `Traceparent` is what at least one proxy in
  the wild emits. A carrier that matched only lowercase would silently start a new
  trace on every request through it, which reads as "propagation does not work" and
  is very hard to see.
