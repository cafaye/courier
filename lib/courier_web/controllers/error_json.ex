defmodule CourierWeb.ErrorJSON do
  @moduledoc """
  Every non-2xx response courier sends, in the one shape core requires
  (`core/docs/openapi-conventions.md`).

  This module is what Phoenix calls for a request that failed before a
  controller could answer it — an unknown route, a 500 — and it is why those
  responses are the same envelope as the ones a controller sends deliberately.
  `CourierWeb.Problem` builds the envelope; this decides which code a status
  means.

  The assigns are the request's (`CourierWeb.Plugs.Trace` put the trace id and the
  path there before the router ran), so a 404 for a path courier does not serve
  still carries the same id as its `X-Trace-Id` header.
