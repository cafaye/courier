  Probe endpoints for orchestrators, load balancers, and humans curling the
  service.

  `healthz` is liveness: it answers as long as this VM can dispatch a request,
  and never touches a dependency. `readyz` is readiness: it answers 503 while
  the service cannot do work, so a deploy can hold traffic back instead of
  serving errors.

  Both sit at the root, outside `/api` (see `CourierWeb.Router`): probes run
  before routing, auth, or any other cafaye service is in play.
