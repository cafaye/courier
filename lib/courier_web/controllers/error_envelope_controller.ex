defmodule CourierWeb.ErrorEnvelopeController do
  @moduledoc """
  The door every service's error path comes through, and the only place a Sentry
  envelope is accepted.

  ## Why this is on its own endpoint and not on `CourierWeb.Router`

  Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters.

  It is **not a customer API operation.** It takes no cafaye principal, it is not
  in `openapi.yaml`, and a generated client should not have it. Putting it on the
  public router would mean either giving it a principal requirement the Sentry SDK
  cannot satisfy — the SDK holds a DSN, not a JWT — or adding a third exclusion to
  `CourierWeb.OpenAPIDocumentTest`'s exclusion list, and the brief is explicit
  that weakening an existing check to make something simpler is not allowed.

  It is **not authenticated the way the rest of courier is.** Everything on
  `/v1` is a caller's request, authenticated by a principal resolved from a bearer
  token, and a wrong answer there is a `401`. This is a machine posting a batch
  of crash reports, authenticated by a shared ingest secret, and a wrong answer
  there is also a `401` but it is a *different* `401` with a different threat
  model: a leaked secret lets somebody fill the error store, not read anybody's
  data. Two authorisation domains, two surfaces, one port each — and the second
  surface is not reachable from the public ingress, which is a deployment
  decision an operator makes rather than a property this module can assert.

  ## What it does with a body it does not like

  It answers `200 {}` and counts a reason. That is not politeness, it is the only
  correct answer: the Sentry SDK retries any non-2xx, so a `400` for a malformed
  envelope means the sender retries a body this relay will never accept, and a
  `500` for a redaction failure means a bug in the redaction boundary becomes a
  retry storm in the service that hit it. The counters in
  `Courier.ErrorRelay.stats/1` are how an operator finds out; the sender's
  experience of a discarded error is silence, which is the correct experience
  for a best-effort store.

  ## Body size is bounded before anything is read

  `max_body_bytes` is enforced in this module rather than left to a `Plug.Parsers`
  limit, because the envelope is **not** a form and not JSON: it is
  newline-delimited binary framing, so the parser pipeline is bypassed entirely
  and `read_body/2` with a `:length` option is the only bound in the path. An
  unbounded read here is an unauthenticated-ish endpoint that a caller can make
  allocate as much memory as it likes, and the ingest secret is a shared secret
  rather than a per-caller credential, so "authenticated" does not mean
  "trusted".
