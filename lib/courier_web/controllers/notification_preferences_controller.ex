defmodule CourierWeb.NotificationPreferencesController do
  @moduledoc """
  The JSON API over notification preferences:
  `GET` and `PUT /v1/notification_preferences/:user_id`.

  Three things are worth saying about the semantics, because each looks like an
  omission and is not:

    * **An unknown user is a 200, not a 404.** identity owns the user table.
      courier is asked about a user id and answers with that user's preferences,
      which for a user who has never touched the settings is three types, all on.
      A 404 would be courier claiming to know something about the requester it
      does not know.
    * **A user id that is not a uuid is a 422 before the body is looked at.** It
      is the one thing courier can check about the request without consulting
      anybody, and there is no point validating a body for a user courier cannot
      address.
    * **A user whose preferences belong to another account *is* a 404.** That is
      the one exception to the first of those, and it is an exception about what
      courier knows rather than about who is asking: with no stored rows courier
      knows nothing about the user, so there is nothing to withhold; with rows
      there is a resource, it belongs to somebody else, and core's conventions
      forbid the 403 that would otherwise confirm it exists.

  Every error is core's problem+json (`CourierWeb.Problem`), with the field named
  as the *request* named it — `preferences[0].notification_type` — because the
  body is what the caller can fix.

  ## Authorization

  Both actions read the account from `conn.assigns.current_account`, which
  `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal` put there, and pass it to
  `Courier.NotificationPreferences` as the first argument.

  An `account_id` in a request cannot reach the row. It is not a field of a
  preference entry at all, so an entry carrying one is refused as the unknown
  key it is — the same answer as `emai_enabled`, and a stronger one than
  `user_id` gets, because `user_id` is a real field that the path overwrites. A
  `account_id` beside the batch, at the top level of the body, names nothing
  courier reads: the body's only key is `preferences`.

  Neither action reads the account from anywhere else, and neither has to check
  whether the caller may read the user: the context answers `{:error, :not_found}`
  and this module turns that into a 404. The check living in the context rather
  than here is deliberate — the same question is asked by `list/2` and
  `update/3`, and a controller that asked it a third way would be a third place
  for it to be wrong.
