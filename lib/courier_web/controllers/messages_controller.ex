  `POST /v1/messages` — courier's HTTP door into `Courier.Deliver`.

  ## The contract, in one sentence

  **A 200 means the provider accepted the message for delivery and courier wrote
  the `courier.email.delivered` row in the same transaction. It does not mean the
  mail arrived**, because a submission protocol says nothing about arrival and
  courier does not have a delivery receipt to report one with. `data.status` reads
  `accepted` for the same reason and never `delivered`.

  ## Synchronous, and why

  The whole send happens inside the request: the preference is read, the
  suppression list is consulted, the provider is dialled, and the outbox row is
  written before the response is built. A caller learns the real outcome — sent,
  declined, suppressed, or the provider said no — rather than a receipt for an
  intention.

  The alternative was genuinely considered and is queued in
  `Courier.Workers`: a 202 would answer before the suppression check ran, and a
  refusal that arrives after the response is a refusal the caller cannot act on.
  "A caller that cannot tell suppressed from sent will retry forever" is not a
  cost a queued contract can pay cheaply. So the send is synchronous, and the
  availability price of that is stated rather than assumed: courier holds a
  database transaction open across the provider's dial, and a provider that is
  slow makes this request slow. What makes it survivable is that the failure is
  honest — a 503 with a code the caller retries — and that the retry is free under
  an `Idempotency-Key`.

  ## The status a caller can act on

  Four refusals, distinguishable by status and `code` alone, because a client
  branches on those and not on `detail`:

  | outcome | status | `code` | retry? |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | accepted for delivery | 200 | — | — |
  | the recipient's mailbox is suppressed | 409 | `conflict` | **no** |
  | the request is wrong, the user declined this type, or they unsubscribed from it | 422 | `validation_failed` | after fixing it |
  | the provider refused, or courier cannot deliver | 503 | `unavailable` | yes, same key |

  **The suppression refusal is a 409 and not a 422**, and the argument is that it
  is not a property of the request. A hard bounce and a spam complaint are facts
  about a *mailbox*, recorded by a provider and not chosen by this caller, and the
  table behind them is never exposed through any route — so this response is the
  only place the fact can surface. 409 `conflict` is core's own code for a request
  that collides with the current state of a resource, and it is the status that
  tells a generated client not to try again. A 422 would tell the caller to change
  a request that cannot be changed.

  **A declined preference is a 422**, which is the opposite answer on purpose. The
  user declining is visible to the caller through
  `GET /v1/notification_preferences/{user_id}`, it is changeable through the `PUT`
  beside it, and `errors[]` — which core reserves for 422 and for nothing else —
  can name `type` as the field that is the problem. A machine reading `code` can
  therefore tell the two refusals apart without parsing prose, and a caller that
  retries neither is the point.

  The suppression response deliberately **does not echo the address** and does not
  distinguish the two states in anything but `detail`. `email_suppressions` has no
  `account_id` by design, so a 409 is a fact about a mailbox rather than about
  another tenant's data; quoting the address would make a probe of guessed
  addresses worth running, and a status nobody can read the table for is the same
  posture the suppression packet took when it declined to expose one.

  ## The pre-flight, which is the same gate the boot checks

  `Courier.MailerAdapter` refuses to boot a courier whose adapter cannot deliver,
  and `Courier.Application` checks the *effective* adapter a second time. This
  action asks the same question a third time, per request, and it exists for a
  reason neither of the other two covers: **the refusal has to be visible to the
  caller.** A courier that booted with a silent adapter and is asked to send would
  otherwise answer 200, write an outbox row and publish `courier.email.delivered`
  for mail nobody receives — the whole failure the adapter work exists to end, one
  layer further out. 503 `unavailable` is the honest answer, and it costs one
  `Application.get_env/2` read.

  It is scoped to production exactly as `verify_boot!/1` is, because `Test` and
  `Local` are the correct adapters in the environments that configure them.

  ## Why the account is not read from the body

  `conn.assigns.current_account`, from `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal`, and nowhere
  else — and `CourierWeb.Messages` refuses an `account_id` in a body as the
  unknown field it is. The tenancy of a *send* is the caller's; the tenancy of the
  recipient's mailbox is not a question courier asks, because the suppression table
  has none to ask with.

  ## Authorization

  One question, and it is answered before the action: is there a principal. The
  default resolver authenticates nobody, so a courier deployed without identity's
  JWT verifier locks this route rather than serving it —
  `test/courier_web/controllers/messages_controller_test.exs` proves the 401, and
  a send endpoint without it would be the platform's open mail relay.
