#
# Courier composes mail and hands it to Swoosh; it never speaks to a provider
# protocol itself, so swapping providers is a config change and not a code
# change. The From address and the subject templates are here because they are
# the two things an operator should be able to reword without touching a
# module. config/runtime.exs overrides `from` from the environment at boot.
#
# Subjects are templates with `%{key}` placeholders, filled from the payload
# the platform hands courier (see `Courier.Mailers.subject/2`). A template that
# names a key the payload does not carry is a configuration error, not a mail
# with a hole in it.

# `api_client: false` is still correct, and now for a real reason rather than

# Swoosh's HTTP client, so leaving this false keeps a dependency courier does not
# use out of the release. It would only need to change for an HTTP-API provider
# (Postmark, SendGrid, Resend), and none of those is configured: they all have an
# SMTP front, and one adapter is one fewer credential path to keep out of logs.

# Error reporting and the error relay. Both OFF by default here; the environment
# files and `runtime.exs` decide.
#
# WHY BOTH ARE OFF IN `config.exs` RATHER THAN IN `dev.exs`
#
# Because "off" is the safe default for the *whole* tree, and a reader who opens
# this file should not have to know which of three files to check. A courier that
# starts and silently reports nothing is a diagnosable state; a courier that
# starts in dev and reports to a developer's machine is not, and the difference
# between the two is one line of configuration.
#
# `:error_reporting` is courier reporting **its own** failures. Its DSN points at
# courier's own relay and at nothing else — see the licence argument in `mix.exs`
# and the misconfiguration argument in `Courier.ErrorReporting.Filter`, which is
# why the SDK filters its own events even though the relay filters them again.
#
# `:error_relay` is courier **receiving** the other two services' failures. Its
# token is required rather than defaulted, for the same reason
# `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY` is: a default would be a shared secret in version
# control that every deployment which forgot to set one would accept error
# reports from.

# The Sentry SDK's own configuration.
#
# `before_send` is the second redaction barrier, and it is the reason this
# deployment is safe from its own misconfiguration:
# `Courier.ErrorReporting.Filter` applies the same allowlist the relay does,
# before the envelope exists, so a DSN pointed at a third party by mistake still
# cannot ship an exception message or a request URL.
#
# `send_default_pii` is off in every Sentry SDK by default and is **stated**
# rather than assumed, because it is the one line whose default an SDK upgrade
# could plausibly change and whose change is invisible in a diff.
#
# No `sample_rate`. Sentry does not sample errors by design, and volume control is
# built in two places this repository owns instead — the client-side limiter and
# `Courier.ErrorRelay`'s fingerprint throttle. A sample rate here would silently
# discard the one crash that mattered.
#
# The transport is the SDK's own business and is left alone: this repository has a
# rule about HTTP clients (`AGENTS.md`: Req, not httpoison/tesla/httpc) and that
# rule is about code *this* repository writes. The SDK's traffic goes to
# courier's relay on the compose network; the relay's traffic to GlitchTip goes
# through Req, which is this repository's client. The two timeouts are set because
# a hung ingest socket must not be able to hold a request open — the relay
# answers before anything is forwarded, and this is the second place that has to
# be true.

  # error-reporting endpoint must not be — the exception is logged by the handler
  # and the caller learns only that something failed.
  #
  # `CourierWeb.ErrorJSON` is therefore configured, exactly as the customer API's

  # that the customer's port is published by compose and this one is not, so a
  # missing `server: true` here does not show up as a refused connection on
