# config/runtime.exs is executed for all environments, including
# during releases. It is executed after compilation and before the
# system starts, so it is typically used to load production configuration
# and secrets from environment variables or elsewhere. Do not define
# any compile-time configuration in here, as it won't be applied.
# The block below contains prod specific runtime configuration.

# ## Using releases
#
# If you use `mix release`, you need to explicitly enable the server
# by passing the PHX_SERVER=true when you start it:
#
#     PHX_SERVER=true bin/courier start
#
# Alternatively, you can use `mix phx.gen.release` to generate a `bin/server`
# script that automatically sets the env var above.
if System.get_env("PHX_SERVER") do
  config :courier, CourierWeb.Endpoint, server: true

  # **Both** endpoints, and the second one is not a copy-paste error. The error
  # endpoint declares `server: false` in `config/config.exs` so that a
  # `mix test` run and a `mix phx.server` run do not bind a second listener, which
  # is the right default; but a release that serves the customer API and does not
  # serve the ingest surface is a relay with no door.
  #
  # This is release-only breakage in the same family as the `Sentry` child-spec
  # mistake in `Courier.Application`: nothing in the suite runs a release, and the
  # symptom is a single log line —
  #
  #     Configuration :server was not enabled for CourierWeb.ErrorEndpoint,
  #     http/https services won't start
  #
  # — which reads like a notice and leaves the relay silently unreachable. It is
  # better than a boot crash and worse than a boot failure, which is the worst
  # combination to debug from a container log.

# OPENTELEMETRY. In every environment, and that is the point.
#
# A developer running `mix phx.server` exports into the collector that ships with
# the stack, and a deployer gets traces without assembling anything. Gating this
# to :prod would make the default a no-op everywhere it is actually used, which is
# backwards.
#
# The RULES are in `Courier.Telemetry` and this is four lines that call into it —
# not a second copy of them. The Erlang SDK is configured through the application
# environment and started by the application controller, which runs before
# `Courier.Application.start/2`, so there is no code path that could set this
# earlier; keeping the logic in a module is what makes it testable at all.
#
# `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is the only contract (core D16). Unset, it is the
# collector that ships with the stack. Set it to anything speaking OTLP and
# courier goes there instead — bring-your-own is a supported deployment, not a
# degraded mode.
#
# NOT IN TEST, and the guard is load-bearing rather than fussy. `runtime.exs` runs
# AFTER every environment's config file, including `test.exs` — so an unguarded
# line here would replace the suite's in-memory exporter with a real OTLP one.
# Every redaction test in this repository asserts the ABSENCE of a canary from the
# exported spans, and a real exporter in a suite with no collector exports
# nothing: all of them would go green, in about a second, having proved nothing.
# A guard whose absence produces a green suite is the worst kind of guard to
# leave to a reader.

# The From address of every transactional email is deployment configuration:

# not infrastructure. Reading the address from the environment here (rather than
# in `Courier.Mailers`) is deliberate: runtime.exs runs once at boot.
#
# This block, and the adapter below it, are prod-only on purpose. runtime.exs
# runs in every environment *after* the env-specific files, so anything set
# outside `if config_env() == :prod` here would silently override test.exs — and

  # into memory and returns a provider-shaped id without opening a socket, so a
  # released courier accepted every send, recorded an outbox row for each one,
  # published a `delivered` event, and mailed nobody. No error and no warning —
  # the worst failure a paid product can have, because it looks like it works.

  # What replaced it is `Courier.MailerAdapter.adapter!/1`, which reads

  # unset, if they name an adapter courier does not ship, or if they name one
  # that cannot deliver. A raise here stops the boot. `Courier.Application`
  # re-checks the resolved adapter as a second, independent gate.
  #
  # Nothing is defaulted. An adapter with a default is an adapter that is wrong
  # for exactly the deployments nobody is watching, and a required setting is the
  # only version of this that cannot be forgotten.

  # generated by the PROVIDER and pasted here, and the two are for opposite
  # directions. A deployment that leaked a customer's outbound signing secret
  # through it must not thereby be able to forge inbound suppressions.
  #
  # Required rather than defaulted, and the reason is specific rather than
  # general. Unset, `Courier.Inbound.Signature.verify/4` refuses every request and
  # every hard bounce and every complaint is DISCARDED — while `POST /v1/messages`
  # goes on mailing addresses that have permanently refused them, and a sending
  # domain's reputation dies of a cause no dashboard names. A default would be
  # worse: a secret in version control that every deployment which forgot to set
  # one would accept forged suppressions under.
  #
  # In Resend's dashboard this is the webhook endpoint's **Signing Secret**,
  # copied from the endpoint's page. It is a Svix secret and carries the `whsec_`
  # prefix, which `Courier.Inbound.Signature` requires — a bare base64 key is
  # `:invalid_secret` and the route answers 500 naming this variable.
  #
  # The `%{…}` and the **string** key are both deliberate, and each for a reason a
  # test holds. `Courier.InboundConfigTest` asserts the stored shape, because
  # neither difference is visible in a config file and both are total in
  # production:
  #
  #   * `config :courier, :inbound_secrets, resend: "…"` — the keyword shorthand
  #     — stores a **keyword list**, and `Application.get_env/2` hands that back
  #     looking nothing like the map the lookup reads. The route would raise
  #     `BadMapError` on the request path, which is the one place that must never
  #     raise: its whole vocabulary is a 401, a 400, a 422 and a 500.
  #   * the key is a **string** because the lookup key comes from the request's
  #     path. An atom there would be `String.to_existing_atom/1` on the request
  #     path of a route, and with `to_atom/1` an unbounded atom table fed by
  #     whoever finds the URL.

  # is a diagnosable state (`ErrorReporting.enabled?/0` is false, and

  # anywhere). It is not required because the error store is an *observability*
  # control, and a courier that refuses to boot because its error store is
  # unreachable has turned a missing integration into an outage — see
  # `Courier.ErrorRelay.Sink.Noop`, which documents the same decision at length.
  #
  # `COURIER_ERROR_RELAY_TOKEN` — the shared secret on the **ingest** surface,

  # tell a service from anybody else, and a default would be a shared secret in
  # version control that every deployment which forgot to set one would accept
  # error reports from. The same rule as `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY` above, and for
