# `test/courier_web/inbound_config_test.exs` asserts the two are the same string,

# The SSRF guard's resolver in test. `Courier.TestSupport.TestDns` answers from

# OpenTelemetry in test, and it is ON.
#
# The suite is where courier's redaction boundary is proved, so telemetry has to be
# on for the proof to mean anything: an allowlist that was never exercised because
# nothing was recorded is an allowlist nobody has checked.
#
# The exporter is `Courier.TestSpanExporter`, which writes into an ETS table
# instead of dialling a collector. Three reasons, and all three are the fleet's
# rules rather than preferences:
#
#   1. Nothing leaves the process. A test that dialled a collector would be a
#      network call in a suite whose rule is no sockets, and a suite that phones an
#      observability backend is a suite that phones an observability backend.
#   2. It is the REAL SDK with a REAL exporter swapped in, so a test reads the
#      payload a collector would have received rather than the test's idea of it.
#   3. `:otel_simple_processor` rather than the batch processor, so a span is
#      finished and exported by the time the request returns. A test that had to
#      wait for a flush timer would need a sleep, and a sleep is a guess about
#      someone else's interval that is wrong on the machine where it matters.
#
# The propagators and the sampler are set because the propagation tests need them
# to be the same two a deployment gets. `root: :always_on` and not
# `{:always_on, []}` — the latter is what kit's Elixir snippet says, it does not
# match this SDK's `otel_sampler:new/1`, and the resulting `:undef` takes the whole
# tracer provider down while its start result is discarded with `_ =`.

# Error reporting is OFF in test, and that is a fact this repository asserts.
#
# Two things are switched off and they are switched off in different places on
# purpose:
#
#   * `:sentry`'s DSN is unset (config/config.exs, inherited), so
#     `Sentry.capture_exception/2` builds nothing and sends nothing. The SDK
#     treats a nil DSN as "do not report", so this is the switch that matters.
#   * `Courier.ErrorReporting.enabled?/0` is false, so courier does not even call
#     the SDK.
#
# `CourierWeb.ErrorReportingTest` asserts both, and asserts that capturing an
# error in the suite puts nothing in any mailbox and opens no socket. "Reporting
# is off in test" is a requirement in the brief, and a requirement nobody checks
# is a requirement that holds until somebody adds a DSN to `test.exs` on a Friday
# afternoon — at which point every test that raises an expected exception
# reports it, and the suite takes minutes and a network.
#
# The relay is configured too, so the *receiving* half of the packet is exercised
# in the suite — `Courier.TestSupport.RecordingSink` stands in for GlitchTip, and
# `COURIER_ERROR_RELAY_TOKEN` is a test-only value in the repository on the same
# terms as `COURIER_SECRET_BOX_KEY` above: a fixture, not a default, and
# `config/runtime.exs` requires a real one in prod and refuses to boot without it.
